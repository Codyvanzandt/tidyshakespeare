Coriolanus	1	1	1	direction	entrance	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	Enter a company of mutinous Citizens with staves,clubs, and other weapons.
Coriolanus	1	1	2	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
Coriolanus	1	1	3	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	Speak, speak!
Coriolanus	1	1	4	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Coriolanus	1	1	5	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	Resolved, resolved!
Coriolanus	1	1	6	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
Coriolanus	1	1	7	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	We know ’t, we know ’t!
Coriolanus	1	1	8	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price. Is ’t a verdict?
Coriolanus	1	1	9	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	No more talking on ’t; let it be done. Away, away!
Coriolanus	1	1	10	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	One word, good citizens.
Coriolanus	1	1	11	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely. But they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
Coriolanus	1	1	12	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?
Coriolanus	1	1	13	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	Against him first. He’s a very dog to the commonalty.
Coriolanus	1	1	14	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Coriolanus	1	1	15	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Very well, and could be content to give him good report for ’t, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Coriolanus	1	1	16	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Nay, but speak not maliciously.
Coriolanus	1	1	17	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
Coriolanus	1	1	18	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	What he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
Coriolanus	1	1	19	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations. He hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  What shouts are these? The other side o’ th’ city is risen. Why stay we prating here? To th’ Capitol!
Coriolanus	1	1	20	direction	shout	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	(Shouts within.)
Coriolanus	1	1	21	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN_Cor	Come, come!
Coriolanus	1	1	22	direction	entrance	Menenius_Cor	Enter Menenius Agrippa.
Coriolanus	1	1	23	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Soft, who comes here?
Coriolanus	1	1	24	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved the people.
Coriolanus	1	1	25	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	He’s one honest enough. Would all the rest were so!
Coriolanus	1	1	26	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	What work ’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
Coriolanus	1	1	27	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.
Coriolanus	1	1	28	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Our business is not unknown to th’ Senate. They have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.
Coriolanus	1	1	29	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbors,
Coriolanus	1	1	30	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Will you undo yourselves?
Coriolanus	1	1	31	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
Coriolanus	1	1	32	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Coriolanus	1	1	33	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Coriolanus	1	1	34	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Coriolanus	1	1	35	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Coriolanus	1	1	36	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Against the Roman state, whose course will on
Coriolanus	1	1	37	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Coriolanus	1	1	38	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Coriolanus	1	1	39	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
Coriolanus	1	1	40	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Coriolanus	1	1	41	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
Coriolanus	1	1	42	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	You are transported by calamity
Coriolanus	1	1	43	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Thither where more attends you, and you slander
Coriolanus	1	1	44	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The helms o’ th’ state, who care for you like fathers,
Coriolanus	1	1	45	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	When you curse them as enemies.
Coriolanus	1	1	46	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Care for us? True, indeed! They ne’er cared for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain; make edicts for usury to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there’s all the love they bear us.
Coriolanus	1	1	47	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious
Coriolanus	1	1	48	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
Coriolanus	1	1	49	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,
Coriolanus	1	1	50	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	But since it serves my purpose, I will venture
Coriolanus	1	1	51	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	To stale ’t a little more.
Coriolanus	1	1	52	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Well, I’ll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an ’t please you, deliver.
Coriolanus	1	1	53	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	There was a time when all the body’s members
Coriolanus	1	1	54	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Rebelled against the belly, thus accused it:
Coriolanus	1	1	55	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	That only like a gulf it did remain
Coriolanus	1	1	56	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I’ th’ midst o’ th’ body, idle and unactive,
Coriolanus	1	1	57	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Coriolanus	1	1	58	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Like labor with the rest, where th’ other instruments
Coriolanus	1	1	59	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
Coriolanus	1	1	60	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	And, mutually participate, did minister
Coriolanus	1	1	61	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Unto the appetite and affection common
Coriolanus	1	1	62	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Of the whole body. The belly answered—
Coriolanus	1	1	63	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
Coriolanus	1	1	64	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Coriolanus	1	1	65	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Which ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus—
Coriolanus	1	1	66	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	For, look you, I may make the belly smile
Coriolanus	1	1	67	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	As well as speak—it tauntingly replied
Coriolanus	1	1	68	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	To th’ discontented members, the mutinous parts
Coriolanus	1	1	69	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
Coriolanus	1	1	70	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	As you malign our senators for that
Coriolanus	1	1	71	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	They are not such as you.
Coriolanus	1	1	72	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Your belly’s answer—what?
Coriolanus	1	1	73	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	The kingly crownèd head, the vigilant eye,
Coriolanus	1	1	74	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	The counselor heart, the arm our soldier,
Coriolanus	1	1	75	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
Coriolanus	1	1	76	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	With other muniments and petty helps
Coriolanus	1	1	77	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	In this our fabric, if that they—
Coriolanus	1	1	78	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	What then?
Coriolanus	1	1	79	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	’Fore me, this fellow speaks. What then? What then?
Coriolanus	1	1	80	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Should by the cormorant belly be restrained,
Coriolanus	1	1	81	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Who is the sink o’ th’ body—
Coriolanus	1	1	82	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Well, what then?
Coriolanus	1	1	83	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	The former agents, if they did complain,
Coriolanus	1	1	84	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	What could the belly answer?
Coriolanus	1	1	85	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I will tell you,
Coriolanus	1	1	86	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	If you’ll bestow a small—of what you have little—
Coriolanus	1	1	87	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Patience awhile, you’st hear the belly’s answer.
Coriolanus	1	1	88	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	You’re long about it.
Coriolanus	1	1	89	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Note me this, good friend;
Coriolanus	1	1	90	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Coriolanus	1	1	91	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:
Coriolanus	1	1	92	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	“True is it, my incorporate friends,” quoth he,
Coriolanus	1	1	93	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	“That I receive the general food at first
Coriolanus	1	1	94	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Coriolanus	1	1	95	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Because I am the storehouse and the shop
Coriolanus	1	1	96	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
Coriolanus	1	1	97	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I send it through the rivers of your blood
Coriolanus	1	1	98	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Even to the court, the heart, to th’ seat o’ th’ brain;
Coriolanus	1	1	99	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	And, through the cranks and offices of man,
Coriolanus	1	1	100	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
Coriolanus	1	1	101	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	From me receive that natural competency
Coriolanus	1	1	102	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Whereby they live. And though that all at once,
Coriolanus	1	1	103	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	You, my good friends”—this says the belly, mark me—
Coriolanus	1	1	104	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	Ay, sir, well, well.
Coriolanus	1	1	105	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	“Though all at once cannot
Coriolanus	1	1	106	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	See what I do deliver out to each,
Coriolanus	1	1	107	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Yet I can make my audit up, that all
Coriolanus	1	1	108	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	From me do back receive the flour of all,
Coriolanus	1	1	109	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	And leave me but the bran.” What say you to ’t?
Coriolanus	1	1	110	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	It was an answer. How apply you this?
Coriolanus	1	1	111	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The senators of Rome are this good belly,
Coriolanus	1	1	112	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	And you the mutinous members. For examine
Coriolanus	1	1	113	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Coriolanus	1	1	114	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Touching the weal o’ th’ common, you shall find
Coriolanus	1	1	115	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	No public benefit which you receive
Coriolanus	1	1	116	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	But it proceeds or comes from them to you
Coriolanus	1	1	117	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
Coriolanus	1	1	118	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	You, the great toe of this assembly?
Coriolanus	1	1	119	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	I the great toe? Why the great toe?
Coriolanus	1	1	120	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	For that, being one o’ th’ lowest, basest, poorest,
Coriolanus	1	1	121	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
Coriolanus	1	1	122	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Coriolanus	1	1	123	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Lead’st first to win some vantage.
Coriolanus	1	1	124	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.
Coriolanus	1	1	125	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
Coriolanus	1	1	126	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The one side must have bale.
Coriolanus	1	1	127	direction	entrance	Coriolanus_Cor	Enter Caius Martius.
Coriolanus	1	1	128	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Hail, noble Martius.
Coriolanus	1	1	129	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Thanks.—What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,
Coriolanus	1	1	130	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Coriolanus	1	1	131	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Make yourselves scabs?
Coriolanus	1	1	132	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.0.2_Cor	We have ever your good word.
Coriolanus	1	1	133	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Coriolanus	1	1	134	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
Coriolanus	1	1	135	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you;
Coriolanus	1	1	136	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Coriolanus	1	1	137	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Coriolanus	1	1	138	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Where foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,
Coriolanus	1	1	139	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
Coriolanus	1	1	140	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
Coriolanus	1	1	141	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,
Coriolanus	1	1	142	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
Coriolanus	1	1	143	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Deserves your hate; and your affections are
Coriolanus	1	1	144	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	A sick man’s appetite, who desires most that
Coriolanus	1	1	145	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Coriolanus	1	1	146	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,
Coriolanus	1	1	147	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang you! Trust you?
Coriolanus	1	1	148	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	With every minute you do change a mind
Coriolanus	1	1	149	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And call him noble that was now your hate,
Coriolanus	1	1	150	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Him vile that was your garland. What’s the matter,
Coriolanus	1	1	151	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That in these several places of the city
Coriolanus	1	1	152	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	You cry against the noble senate, who,
Coriolanus	1	1	153	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Coriolanus	1	1	154	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Would feed on one another?—What’s their seeking?
Coriolanus	1	1	155	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
Coriolanus	1	1	156	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The city is well stored.
Coriolanus	1	1	157	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Hang ’em! They say?
Coriolanus	1	1	158	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They’ll sit by th’ fire and presume to know
Coriolanus	1	1	159	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	What’s done i’ th’ Capitol, who’s like to rise,
Coriolanus	1	1	160	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Who thrives, and who declines; side factions and give out
Coriolanus	1	1	161	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Conjectural marriages, making parties strong
Coriolanus	1	1	162	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Coriolanus	1	1	163	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Below their cobbled shoes. They say there’s grain enough?
Coriolanus	1	1	164	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
Coriolanus	1	1	165	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And let me use my sword, I’d make a quarry
Coriolanus	1	1	166	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	With thousands of these quartered slaves as high
Coriolanus	1	1	167	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	As I could pick my lance.
Coriolanus	1	1	168	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
Coriolanus	1	1	169	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Coriolanus	1	1	170	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,
Coriolanus	1	1	171	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	What says the other troop?
Coriolanus	1	1	172	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They are dissolved. Hang ’em!
Coriolanus	1	1	173	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They said they were an-hungry, sighed forth proverbs
Coriolanus	1	1	174	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
Coriolanus	1	1	175	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Coriolanus	1	1	176	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
Coriolanus	1	1	177	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They vented their complainings, which being answered
Coriolanus	1	1	178	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And a petition granted them—a strange one,
Coriolanus	1	1	179	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To break the heart of generosity
Coriolanus	1	1	180	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps
Coriolanus	1	1	181	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	As they would hang them on the horns o’ th’ moon,
Coriolanus	1	1	182	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Shouting their emulation.
Coriolanus	1	1	183	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	What is granted them?
Coriolanus	1	1	184	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Coriolanus	1	1	185	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Of their own choice. One’s Junius Brutus,
Coriolanus	1	1	186	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. ’Sdeath!
Coriolanus	1	1	187	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The rabble should have first unroofed the city
Coriolanus	1	1	188	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Ere so prevailed with me. It will in time
Coriolanus	1	1	189	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
Coriolanus	1	1	190	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	For insurrection’s arguing.
Coriolanus	1	1	191	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	This is strange.

Coriolanus	1	1	196	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.X.1_Cor	The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
Coriolanus	1	1	197	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	I am glad on ’t. Then we shall ha’ means to vent

Coriolanus	1	1	201	speech	verse	SENATORS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Martius, ’tis true that you have lately told us:
Coriolanus	1	1	202	speech	verse	SENATORS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	The Volsces are in arms.
Coriolanus	1	1	203	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They have a leader,

Coriolanus	1	3	327	speech	prose	Volumnia_Cor	I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how honor would become such a person—that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not stir—was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.

Coriolanus	1	3	339	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Though you were born in Rome.” His bloody brow
Coriolanus	1	3	340	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	With his mailed hand then wiping, forth he goes

Coriolanus	1	3	360	speech	prose	Volumnia_Cor	He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.
Coriolanus	1	3	361	speech	prose	Valeria_Cor	O’ my word, the father’s son! I’ll swear ’tis a very pretty boy. O’ my troth, I looked upon him o’ Wednesday half an hour together. H’as such a confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again, catched it again. Or whether his fall enraged him or how ’twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant how he mammocked it!

Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth, against whom Cominius the General is gone with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so, I pray, go with us.

Coriolanus	2	1	839	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Well, well, sir, well?
Coriolanus	2	1	840	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures, at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius for being proud.
Coriolanus	2	1	841	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	We do it not alone, sir.
Coriolanus	2	1	842	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O, that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O, that you could!
Coriolanus	2	1	843	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	What then, sir?
Coriolanus	2	1	843	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	What then, sir?
Coriolanus	2	1	844	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Coriolanus	2	1	845	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Menenius, you are known well enough, too.
Coriolanus	2	1	846	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in ’t; said to be something imperfect in favoring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables. And though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough, too?
Coriolanus	2	1	847	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.
Coriolanus	2	1	848	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything. You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a faucet-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.
Coriolanus	2	1	849	speech	prose	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Come, come. You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
Coriolanus	2	1	850	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s cushion or to be entombed in an ass’s packsaddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud, who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of ’em were hereditary hangmen. Good e’en to your Worships. More of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.

Coriolanus	2	1	974	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	From where he should begin and end, but will
Coriolanus	2	1	975	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Lose those he hath won.

Coriolanus	2	1	979	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Upon their ancient malice will forget

Coriolanus	2	1	982	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	As he is proud to do ’t.
Coriolanus	2	1	983	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	I heard him swear,
Coriolanus	2	1	984	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Coriolanus	2	1	985	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Appear i’ th’ marketplace nor on him put
Coriolanus	2	1	986	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	The napless vesture of humility,

Coriolanus	2	1	988	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	To th’ people, beg their stinking breaths.
Coriolanus	2	1	989	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	’Tis right.
Coriolanus	2	1	990	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Coriolanus	2	1	991	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
Coriolanus	2	1	992	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	And the desire of the nobles.
Coriolanus	2	1	993	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	I wish no better
Coriolanus	2	1	994	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
Coriolanus	2	1	995	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	In execution.
Coriolanus	2	1	996	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	’Tis most like he will.

Coriolanus	2	1	1002	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	He still hath held them; that to ’s power he would
Coriolanus	2	1	1003	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and
Coriolanus	2	1	1004	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them

Coriolanus	2	2	1037	speech	prose	OFFICERS.2_Cor	’Faith, there hath been many great men that have flattered the people who ne’er loved them; and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see ’t.
Coriolanus	2	2	1038	speech	prose	OFFICERS.1_Cor	If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently ’twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Coriolanus	2	2	1039	speech	prose	OFFICERS.2_Cor	He hath deserved worthily of his country, and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report; but he hath so planted his honors in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury. To report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

Coriolanus	2	2	1104	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	I shall lack voice. The deeds of Coriolanus
Coriolanus	2	2	1105	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Should not be uttered feebly. It is held
Coriolanus	2	2	1106	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	That valor is the chiefest virtue and
Coriolanus	2	2	1107	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Most dignifies the haver; if it be,
Coriolanus	2	2	1108	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	The man I speak of cannot in the world
Coriolanus	2	2	1109	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
Coriolanus	2	2	1110	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Coriolanus	2	2	1111	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Beyond the mark of others. Our then dictator,
Coriolanus	2	2	1112	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight
Coriolanus	2	2	1113	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	When with his Amazonian chin he drove
Coriolanus	2	2	1114	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	The bristled lips before him. He bestrid
Coriolanus	2	2	1115	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	An o’erpressed Roman and i’ th’ Consul’s view
Coriolanus	2	2	1116	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Slew three opposers. Tarquin’s self he met
Coriolanus	2	2	1117	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And struck him on his knee. In that day’s feats,
Coriolanus	2	2	1118	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	When he might act the woman in the scene,
Coriolanus	2	2	1119	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	He proved best man i’ th’ field and for his meed
Coriolanus	2	2	1120	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Coriolanus	2	2	1121	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Man-entered thus, he waxèd like a sea,
Coriolanus	2	2	1122	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
Coriolanus	2	2	1123	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	He lurched all swords of the garland. For this last,
Coriolanus	2	2	1124	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Before and in Corioles, let me say,
Coriolanus	2	2	1125	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	I cannot speak him home. He stopped the flyers
Coriolanus	2	2	1126	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And by his rare example made the coward
Coriolanus	2	2	1127	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Turn terror into sport. As weeds before
Coriolanus	2	2	1128	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	A vessel under sail, so men obeyed
Coriolanus	2	2	1129	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And fell below his stem. His sword, Death’s stamp,
Coriolanus	2	2	1130	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
Coriolanus	2	2	1131	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Coriolanus	2	2	1132	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Was timed with dying cries. Alone he entered
Coriolanus	2	2	1133	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	The mortal gate o’ th’ city, which he painted
Coriolanus	2	2	1134	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	With shunless destiny; aidless came off
Coriolanus	2	2	1135	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Coriolanus	2	2	1136	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Corioles like a planet. Now all’s his,
Coriolanus	2	2	1137	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	When by and by the din of war gan pierce
Coriolanus	2	2	1138	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Coriolanus	2	2	1139	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Requickened what in flesh was fatigate,
Coriolanus	2	2	1140	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And to the battle came he, where he did
Coriolanus	2	2	1141	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Run reeking o’er the lives of men as if
Coriolanus	2	2	1142	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	’Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we called
Coriolanus	2	2	1143	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Both field and city ours, he never stood
Coriolanus	2	2	1144	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	To ease his breast with panting.
Coriolanus	2	2	1145	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Worthy man!
Coriolanus	2	2	1146	speech	verse	SENATORS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	He cannot but with measure fit the honors
Coriolanus	2	2	1147	speech	verse	SENATORS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Which we devise him.
Coriolanus	2	2	1148	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Our spoils he kicked at
Coriolanus	2	2	1149	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And looked upon things precious as they were
Coriolanus	2	2	1150	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	The common muck of the world. He covets less
Coriolanus	2	2	1151	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Than misery itself would give, rewards
Coriolanus	2	2	1152	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	His deeds with doing them, and is content

So, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude, of the which, we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.
Coriolanus	2	3	1206	speech	prose	CITIZENS.ROMAN.1_Cor	And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Coriolanus	2	3	1323	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	Certainly, he flouted us downright.
Coriolanus	2	3	1324	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.1_Cor	No, ’tis his kind of speech. He did not mock us.
Coriolanus	2	3	1325	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.2_Cor	Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
Coriolanus	2	3	1326	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.2_Cor	He used us scornfully. He should have showed us
Coriolanus	2	3	1327	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.2_Cor	His marks of merit, wounds received for ’s country.
Coriolanus	2	3	1328	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Why, so he did, I am sure.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.1_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.2_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.4_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.5_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.6_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.7_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1329	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.8_Cor	No, no. No man saw ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1330	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	He said he had wounds, which he could show in private,
Coriolanus	2	3	1331	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
Coriolanus	2	3	1332	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	“I would be consul,” says he. “Agèd custom,
Coriolanus	2	3	1333	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Coriolanus	2	3	1334	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	Your voices therefore.” When we granted that,
Coriolanus	2	3	1335	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	Here was “I thank you for your voices. Thank you.
Coriolanus	2	3	1336	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	Your most sweet voices! Now you have left your voices,
Coriolanus	2	3	1337	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	I have no further with you.” Was not this mockery?
Coriolanus	2	3	1338	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Why either were you ignorant to see ’t
Coriolanus	2	3	1339	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
Coriolanus	2	3	1340	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	To yield your voices?
Coriolanus	2	3	1341	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Could you not have told him
Coriolanus	2	3	1342	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	As you were lessoned? When he had no power,
Coriolanus	2	3	1343	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	But was a petty servant to the state,
Coriolanus	2	3	1344	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	He was your enemy, ever spake against
Coriolanus	2	3	1345	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Your liberties and the charters that you bear
Coriolanus	2	3	1346	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	I’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving
Coriolanus	2	3	1347	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	A place of potency and sway o’ th’ state,
Coriolanus	2	3	1348	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	If he should still malignantly remain
Coriolanus	2	3	1349	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might
Coriolanus	2	3	1350	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Be curses to yourselves. You should have said
Coriolanus	2	3	1351	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Coriolanus	2	3	1352	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Coriolanus	2	3	1353	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Would think upon you for your voices, and
Coriolanus	2	3	1354	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Translate his malice towards you into love,
Coriolanus	2	3	1355	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Standing your friendly lord.
Coriolanus	2	3	1356	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Thus to have said,
Coriolanus	2	3	1357	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	As you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit
Coriolanus	2	3	1358	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	And tried his inclination; from him plucked
Coriolanus	2	3	1359	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Either his gracious promise, which you might,
Coriolanus	2	3	1360	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	As cause had called you up, have held him to;
Coriolanus	2	3	1361	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Or else it would have galled his surly nature,
Coriolanus	2	3	1362	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Which easily endures not article
Coriolanus	2	3	1363	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Tying him to aught. So putting him to rage,
Coriolanus	2	3	1364	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	You should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler
Coriolanus	2	3	1365	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	And passed him unelected.
Coriolanus	2	3	1366	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Did you perceive
Coriolanus	2	3	1367	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	He did solicit you in free contempt
Coriolanus	2	3	1368	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	When he did need your loves, and do you think
Coriolanus	2	3	1369	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
Coriolanus	2	3	1370	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
Coriolanus	2	3	1371	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
Coriolanus	2	3	1372	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Against the rectorship of judgment?
Coriolanus	2	3	1373	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Have you ere now denied the asker? And now
Coriolanus	2	3	1374	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Again, of him that did not ask but mock,
Coriolanus	2	3	1375	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Bestow your sued-for tongues?
Coriolanus	2	3	1376	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	He’s not confirmed.
Coriolanus	2	3	1377	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.3_Cor	We may deny him yet.
Coriolanus	2	3	1378	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.2_Cor	And will deny him.
Coriolanus	2	3	1379	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.2_Cor	I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.
Coriolanus	2	3	1380	speech	verse	CITIZENS.ROMAN.1_Cor	I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece ’em.
Coriolanus	2	3	1381	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
Coriolanus	2	3	1382	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	They have chose a consul that will from them take
Coriolanus	2	3	1383	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Their liberties, make them of no more voice
Coriolanus	2	3	1384	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
Coriolanus	2	3	1385	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	As therefor kept to do so.
Coriolanus	2	3	1386	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Let them assemble
Coriolanus	2	3	1387	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
Coriolanus	2	3	1388	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
Coriolanus	2	3	1389	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not
Coriolanus	2	3	1390	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
Coriolanus	2	3	1391	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves,
Coriolanus	2	3	1392	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Thinking upon his services, took from you
Coriolanus	2	3	1393	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Th’ apprehension of his present portance,
Coriolanus	2	3	1394	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
Coriolanus	2	3	1395	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	After the inveterate hate he bears you.
Coriolanus	2	3	1396	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Lay
Coriolanus	2	3	1397	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labored,
Coriolanus	2	3	1398	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	No impediment between, but that you must
Coriolanus	2	3	1399	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Cast your election on him.
Coriolanus	2	3	1400	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Say you chose him
Coriolanus	2	3	1401	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	More after our commandment than as guided
Coriolanus	2	3	1402	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Coriolanus	2	3	1403	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Coriolanus	2	3	1404	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Than what you should, made you against the grain
Coriolanus	2	3	1405	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
Coriolanus	2	3	1406	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
Coriolanus	2	3	1407	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	How youngly he began to serve his country,
Coriolanus	2	3	1408	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
Coriolanus	2	3	1409	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	The noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came
Coriolanus	2	3	1410	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,
Coriolanus	2	3	1411	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Who after great Hostilius here was king,
Coriolanus	2	3	1412	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
Coriolanus	2	3	1413	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	That our best water brought by conduits hither;
Coriolanus	2	3	1414	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	And Censorinus, that was so surnamed,
Coriolanus	2	3	1415	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	And nobly namèd so, twice being censor,
Coriolanus	2	3	1416	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Was his great ancestor.
Coriolanus	2	3	1417	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	One thus descended,
Coriolanus	2	3	1418	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	That hath besides well in his person wrought
Coriolanus	2	3	1419	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	To be set high in place, we did commend
Coriolanus	2	3	1420	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	To your remembrances; but you have found,
Coriolanus	2	3	1421	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Scaling his present bearing with his past,
Coriolanus	2	3	1422	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	That he’s your fixèd enemy, and revoke
Coriolanus	2	3	1423	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Your sudden approbation.
Coriolanus	2	3	1424	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Say you ne’er had done ’t—
Coriolanus	2	3	1425	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Harp on that still—but by our putting on.
Coriolanus	2	3	1426	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Coriolanus	2	3	1427	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Repair to th’ Capitol.

Coriolanus	3	1	1505	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	You are like to do such business.
Coriolanus	3	1	1506	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Not unlike, each way, to better yours.
Coriolanus	3	1	1507	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Coriolanus	3	1	1508	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Coriolanus	3	1	1509	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Your fellow tribune.
Coriolanus	3	1	1510	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	You show too much of that
Coriolanus	3	1	1511	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	For which the people stir. If you will pass
Coriolanus	3	1	1512	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Coriolanus	3	1	1513	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Coriolanus	3	1	1514	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Or never be so noble as a consul,
Coriolanus	3	1	1515	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Nor yoke with him for tribune.
Coriolanus	3	1	1516	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Let’s be calm.
Coriolanus	3	1	1517	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	The people are abused, set on. This palt’ring
Coriolanus	3	1	1518	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Coriolanus	3	1	1519	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Deserved this so dishonored rub, laid falsely
Coriolanus	3	1	1520	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	I’ th’ plain way of his merit.
Coriolanus	3	1	1521	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Tell me of corn?
Coriolanus	3	1	1522	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	This was my speech, and I will speak ’t again.
Coriolanus	3	1	1523	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Not now, not now.
Coriolanus	3	1	1524	speech	verse	SENATORS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	Not in this heat, sir, now.
Coriolanus	3	1	1525	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Now, as I live, I will.
Coriolanus	3	1	1526	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For
Coriolanus	3	1	1527	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
Coriolanus	3	1	1528	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Regard me, as I do not flatter, and
Coriolanus	3	1	1529	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Therein behold themselves. I say again,
Coriolanus	3	1	1530	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	In soothing them, we nourish ’gainst our senate
Coriolanus	3	1	1531	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Coriolanus	3	1	1532	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Which we ourselves have plowed for, sowed, and scattered
Coriolanus	3	1	1533	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	By mingling them with us, the honored number,
Coriolanus	3	1	1534	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Coriolanus	3	1	1535	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Which they have given to beggars.
Coriolanus	3	1	1536	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Well, no more.
Coriolanus	3	1	1537	speech	verse	SENATORS.ROMAN.0.1_Cor	No more words, we beseech you.
Coriolanus	3	1	1538	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	How? No more?
Coriolanus	3	1	1539	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	As for my country I have shed my blood,
Coriolanus	3	1	1540	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coriolanus	3	1	1541	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Coin words till their decay against those measles
Coriolanus	3	1	1542	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
Coriolanus	3	1	1543	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The very way to catch them.
Coriolanus	3	1	1544	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	You speak o’ th’ people
Coriolanus	3	1	1545	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	As if you were a god to punish, not
Coriolanus	3	1	1546	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	A man of their infirmity.
Coriolanus	3	1	1547	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	’Twere well
Coriolanus	3	1	1548	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	We let the people know ’t.
Coriolanus	3	1	1549	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	What, what? His choler?
Coriolanus	3	1	1550	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Choler?
Coriolanus	3	1	1551	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
Coriolanus	3	1	1552	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	By Jove, ’twould be my mind.
Coriolanus	3	1	1553	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	It is a mind
Coriolanus	3	1	1554	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	That shall remain a poison where it is,
Coriolanus	3	1	1555	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Not poison any further.
Coriolanus	3	1	1556	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	“Shall remain”?
Coriolanus	3	1	1557	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
Coriolanus	3	1	1558	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	His absolute “shall”?
Coriolanus	3	1	1559	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	’Twas from the canon.
Coriolanus	3	1	1560	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	“Shall”?
Coriolanus	3	1	1561	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	O good but most unwise patricians, why,
Coriolanus	3	1	1562	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Coriolanus	3	1	1563	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
Coriolanus	3	1	1564	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That with his peremptory “shall,” being but
Coriolanus	3	1	1565	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The horn and noise o’ th’ monster’s, wants not spirit
Coriolanus	3	1	1566	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch
Coriolanus	3	1	1567	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And make your channel his? If he have power,
Coriolanus	3	1	1568	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Coriolanus	3	1	1569	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Your dangerous lenity. If you are learned,
Coriolanus	3	1	1570	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Coriolanus	3	1	1571	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
Coriolanus	3	1	1572	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	If they be senators; and they are no less
Coriolanus	3	1	1573	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	When, both your voices blended, the great’st taste
Coriolanus	3	1	1574	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
Coriolanus	3	1	1575	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And such a one as he, who puts his “shall,”
Coriolanus	3	1	1576	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	His popular “shall,” against a graver bench
Coriolanus	3	1	1577	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Than ever frowned in Greece. By Jove himself,
Coriolanus	3	1	1578	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	It makes the consuls base! And my soul aches
Coriolanus	3	1	1579	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To know, when two authorities are up,
Coriolanus	3	1	1580	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Neither supreme, how soon confusion
Coriolanus	3	1	1581	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	May enter ’twixt the gap of both and take
Coriolanus	3	1	1582	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The one by th’ other.
Coriolanus	3	1	1583	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Well, on to th’ marketplace.
Coriolanus	3	1	1584	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
Coriolanus	3	1	1585	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The corn o’ th’ storehouse gratis, as ’twas used
Coriolanus	3	1	1586	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Sometime in Greece—
Coriolanus	3	1	1587	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Well, well, no more of that.
Coriolanus	3	1	1588	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Though there the people had more absolute power,
Coriolanus	3	1	1589	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	I say they nourished disobedience, fed
Coriolanus	3	1	1590	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The ruin of the state.
Coriolanus	3	1	1591	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Why shall the people give
Coriolanus	3	1	1592	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	One that speaks thus their voice?
Coriolanus	3	1	1593	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	I’ll give my reasons,
Coriolanus	3	1	1594	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Coriolanus	3	1	1595	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Was not our recompense, resting well assured
Coriolanus	3	1	1596	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They ne’er did service for ’t. Being pressed to th’ war,
Coriolanus	3	1	1597	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Even when the navel of the state was touched,
Coriolanus	3	1	1598	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Coriolanus	3	1	1599	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ th’ war,
Coriolanus	3	1	1600	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they showed
Coriolanus	3	1	1601	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Most valor, spoke not for them. Th’ accusation
Coriolanus	3	1	1602	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Which they have often made against the Senate,
Coriolanus	3	1	1603	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	All cause unborn, could never be the native
Coriolanus	3	1	1604	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
Coriolanus	3	1	1605	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	How shall this bosom multiplied digest
Coriolanus	3	1	1606	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The Senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express
Coriolanus	3	1	1607	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	What’s like to be their words: “We did request it;
Coriolanus	3	1	1608	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	We are the greater poll, and in true fear
Coriolanus	3	1	1609	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase
Coriolanus	3	1	1610	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Coriolanus	3	1	1611	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Call our cares fears, which will in time
Coriolanus	3	1	1612	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Break ope the locks o’ th’ Senate and bring in
Coriolanus	3	1	1613	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The crows to peck the eagles.
Coriolanus	3	1	1614	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Come, enough.
Coriolanus	3	1	1615	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Enough, with over-measure.
Coriolanus	3	1	1616	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	No, take more!
Coriolanus	3	1	1617	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Coriolanus	3	1	1618	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Seal what I end withal! This double worship—
Coriolanus	3	1	1619	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Coriolanus	3	1	1620	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom
Coriolanus	3	1	1621	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Coriolanus	3	1	1622	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Of general ignorance—it must omit
Coriolanus	3	1	1623	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Real necessities and give way the while
Coriolanus	3	1	1624	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To unstable slightness. Purpose so barred, it follows
Coriolanus	3	1	1625	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you—
Coriolanus	3	1	1626	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	You that will be less fearful than discreet,
Coriolanus	3	1	1627	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That love the fundamental part of state
Coriolanus	3	1	1628	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	More than you doubt the change on ’t, that prefer
Coriolanus	3	1	1629	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	A noble life before a long, and wish
Coriolanus	3	1	1630	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To jump a body with a dangerous physic
Coriolanus	3	1	1631	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That’s sure of death without it—at once pluck out
Coriolanus	3	1	1632	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
Coriolanus	3	1	1633	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonor
Coriolanus	3	1	1634	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Coriolanus	3	1	1635	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Of that integrity which should become ’t,
Coriolanus	3	1	1636	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Not having the power to do the good it would
Coriolanus	3	1	1637	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	For th’ ill which doth control ’t.
Coriolanus	3	1	1638	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	’Has said enough.
Coriolanus	3	1	1639	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	’Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
Coriolanus	3	1	1640	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	As traitors do.
Coriolanus	3	1	1641	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!
Coriolanus	3	1	1642	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
Coriolanus	3	1	1643	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	On whom depending, their obedience fails
Coriolanus	3	1	1644	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To th’ greater bench? In a rebellion,
Coriolanus	3	1	1645	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	When what’s not meet but what must be was law,
Coriolanus	3	1	1646	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Then were they chosen. In a better hour,
Coriolanus	3	1	1647	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
Coriolanus	3	1	1648	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And throw their power i’ th’ dust.
Coriolanus	3	1	1649	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	Manifest treason.
Coriolanus	3	1	1650	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	This a consul? No.

Coriolanus	3	1	1691	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	By the consent of all, we were established

Coriolanus	3	1	1694	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	And so are like to do.
Coriolanus	3	1	1695	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	That is the way to lay the city flat,
Coriolanus	3	1	1696	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	To bring the roof to the foundation

Coriolanus	3	2	1927	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Repent what you have spoke.
Coriolanus	3	2	1928	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	For them? I cannot do it to the gods.
Coriolanus	3	2	1929	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Must I then do ’t to them?
Coriolanus	3	2	1930	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	You are too absolute,
Coriolanus	3	2	1931	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Though therein you can never be too noble
Coriolanus	3	2	1932	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	But when extremities speak. I have heard you say
Coriolanus	3	2	1933	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Honor and policy, like unsevered friends,
Coriolanus	3	2	1934	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	I’ th’ war do grow together. Grant that, and tell me
Coriolanus	3	2	1935	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	In peace what each of them by th’ other lose
Coriolanus	3	2	1936	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	That they combine not there?
Coriolanus	3	2	1937	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Tush, tush!
Coriolanus	3	2	1938	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	A good demand.
Coriolanus	3	2	1939	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	If it be honor in your wars to seem
Coriolanus	3	2	1940	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	The same you are not, which for your best ends
Coriolanus	3	2	1941	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse
Coriolanus	3	2	1942	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	That it shall hold companionship in peace
Coriolanus	3	2	1943	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	With honor as in war, since that to both
Coriolanus	3	2	1944	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	It stands in like request?
Coriolanus	3	2	1945	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Why force you this?
Coriolanus	3	2	1946	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Because that now it lies you on to speak
Coriolanus	3	2	1947	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	To th’ people, not by your own instruction,
Coriolanus	3	2	1948	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Nor by th’ matter which your heart prompts you,
Coriolanus	3	2	1949	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	But with such words that are but roted in
Coriolanus	3	2	1950	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Coriolanus	3	2	1951	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Of no allowance to your bosom’s truth.
Coriolanus	3	2	1952	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Now, this no more dishonors you at all
Coriolanus	3	2	1953	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Coriolanus	3	2	1954	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Which else would put you to your fortune and
Coriolanus	3	2	1955	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	The hazard of much blood.
Coriolanus	3	2	1956	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	I would dissemble with my nature where
Coriolanus	3	2	1957	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	My fortunes and my friends at stake required
Coriolanus	3	2	1958	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	I should do so in honor. I am in this
Coriolanus	3	2	1959	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
Coriolanus	3	2	1960	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	And you will rather show our general louts
Coriolanus	3	2	1961	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	How you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em
Coriolanus	3	2	1962	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Coriolanus	3	2	1963	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Of what that want might ruin.
Coriolanus	3	2	1964	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Noble lady!—

Coriolanus	3	2	1966	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Coriolanus	3	2	1967	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Of what is past.
Coriolanus	3	2	1968	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	I prithee now, my son,
Coriolanus	3	2	1969	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand,
Coriolanus	3	2	1970	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	And thus far having stretched it—here be with them—
Coriolanus	3	2	1971	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such business
Coriolanus	3	2	1972	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th’ ignorant
Coriolanus	3	2	1973	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	More learnèd than the ears—waving thy head,
Coriolanus	3	2	1974	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Which often thus correcting thy stout heart,
Coriolanus	3	2	1975	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Now humble as the ripest mulberry
Coriolanus	3	2	1976	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	That will not hold the handling. Or say to them
Coriolanus	3	2	1977	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,
Coriolanus	3	2	1978	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Hast not the soft way, which thou dost confess
Coriolanus	3	2	1979	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
Coriolanus	3	2	1980	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
Coriolanus	3	2	1981	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
Coriolanus	3	2	1982	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	As thou hast power and person.
Coriolanus	3	2	1983	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	This but done
Coriolanus	3	2	1984	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
Coriolanus	3	2	1985	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	For they have pardons, being asked, as free
Coriolanus	3	2	1986	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	As words to little purpose.
Coriolanus	3	2	1987	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Prithee now,
Coriolanus	3	2	1988	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Go, and be ruled; although I know thou hadst rather
Coriolanus	3	2	1989	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf

Coriolanus	3	2	1995	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	By calmness or by absence. All’s in anger.

Coriolanus	3	2	2001	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Must I go show them my unbarbèd sconce? Must I

Coriolanus	3	2	2003	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do ’t.

Coriolanus	3	2	2005	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	This mold of Martius, they to dust should grind it
Coriolanus	3	2	2006	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	And throw ’t against the wind. To th’ marketplace!

Coriolanus	3	2	2012	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	To have my praise for this, perform a part
Coriolanus	3	2	2013	speech	verse	Volumnia_Cor	Thou hast not done before.
Coriolanus	3	2	2014	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Well, I must do ’t.

Coriolanus	3	3	2142	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	We charge you that you have contrived to take
Coriolanus	3	3	2143	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	From Rome all seasoned office and to wind
Coriolanus	3	3	2144	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Yourself into a power tyrannical,
Coriolanus	3	3	2145	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	For which you are a traitor to the people.
Coriolanus	3	3	2146	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	How? Traitor?
Coriolanus	3	3	2147	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Nay, temperately! Your promise.
Coriolanus	3	3	2148	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	The fires i’ th’ lowest hell fold in the people!
Coriolanus	3	3	2149	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Call me their traitor? Thou injurious tribune!
Coriolanus	3	3	2150	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
Coriolanus	3	3	2151	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	In thy hands clutched as many millions, in
Coriolanus	3	3	2152	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
Coriolanus	3	3	2153	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	“Thou liest” unto thee with a voice as free
Coriolanus	3	3	2154	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	As I do pray the gods.

Coriolanus	3	3	2157	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Peace!
Coriolanus	3	3	2158	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	We need not put new matter to his charge.
Coriolanus	3	3	2159	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Coriolanus	3	3	2160	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
Coriolanus	3	3	2161	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
Coriolanus	3	3	2162	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Those whose great power must try him—even this,
Coriolanus	3	3	2163	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	So criminal and in such capital kind,
Coriolanus	3	3	2164	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Deserves th’ extremest death.

Coriolanus	3	3	2168	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Brutus_Cor	I talk of that that know it.
Coriolanus	3	3	2169	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	You?
Coriolanus	3	3	2170	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Is this the promise that you made your mother?
Coriolanus	3	3	2171	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Know, I pray you—
Coriolanus	3	3	2172	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	I’ll know no further.
Coriolanus	3	3	2173	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Coriolanus	3	3	2174	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
Coriolanus	3	3	2175	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Coriolanus	3	3	2176	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
Coriolanus	3	3	2177	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	Nor check my courage for what they can give,

Coriolanus	3	3	2179	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	For that he has,
Coriolanus	3	3	2180	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	As much as in him lies, from time to time
Coriolanus	3	3	2181	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Envied against the people, seeking means
Coriolanus	3	3	2182	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	To pluck away their power, as now at last
Coriolanus	3	3	2183	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Coriolanus	3	3	2184	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
Coriolanus	3	3	2185	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	That doth distribute it, in the name o’ th’ people
Coriolanus	3	3	2186	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	And in the power of us the Tribunes, we,

Coriolanus	3	3	2196	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Let me speak.
Coriolanus	3	3	2197	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	I have been consul and can show for Rome
Coriolanus	3	3	2198	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Her enemies’ marks upon me. I do love

Coriolanus	3	3	2200	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	More holy and profound, than mine own life,

Coriolanus	3	3	2202	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	And treasure of my loins. Then if I would
Coriolanus	3	3	2203	speech	verse	Cominius_Cor	Speak that—
Coriolanus	3	3	2204	speech	verse	TRIBUNES.Sicinius_Cor	We know your drift. Speak what?

Coriolanus	4	5	2546	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
Coriolanus	4	5	2547	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Coriolanus	4	5	2548	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Should from yond cloud speak divine things
Coriolanus	4	5	2549	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	And say ’tis true, I’d not believe them more
Coriolanus	4	5	2550	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Than thee, all-noble Martius. Let me twine
Coriolanus	4	5	2551	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Mine arms about that body, whereagainst
Coriolanus	4	5	2552	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	My grainèd ash an hundred times hath broke

Coriolanus	4	5	2555	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Here I clip
Coriolanus	4	5	2556	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	The anvil of my sword and do contest
Coriolanus	4	5	2557	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	As hotly and as nobly with thy love
Coriolanus	4	5	2558	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	As ever in ambitious strength I did
Coriolanus	4	5	2559	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Contend against thy valor. Know thou first,
Coriolanus	4	5	2560	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	I loved the maid I married; never man
Coriolanus	4	5	2561	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee here,
Coriolanus	4	5	2562	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart
Coriolanus	4	5	2563	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Coriolanus	4	5	2564	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell thee
Coriolanus	4	5	2565	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	We have a power on foot, and I had purpose
Coriolanus	4	5	2566	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
Coriolanus	4	5	2567	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Or lose mine arm for ’t. Thou hast beat me out
Coriolanus	4	5	2568	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Coriolanus	4	5	2569	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;
Coriolanus	4	5	2570	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	We have been down together in my sleep,
Coriolanus	4	5	2571	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,
Coriolanus	4	5	2572	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,
Coriolanus	4	5	2573	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
Coriolanus	4	5	2574	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Thou art thence banished, we would muster all
Coriolanus	4	5	2575	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	From twelve to seventy and, pouring war
Coriolanus	4	5	2576	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Coriolanus	4	5	2577	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Like a bold flood o’erbear ’t. O, come, go in,
Coriolanus	4	5	2578	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	And take our friendly senators by th’ hands,
Coriolanus	4	5	2579	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Coriolanus	4	5	2580	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Who am prepared against your territories,

Coriolanus	4	5	2582	speech	verse	Coriolanus_Cor	You bless me, gods!
Coriolanus	4	5	2583	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have

Coriolanus	4	5	2589	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Or rudely visit them in parts remote
Coriolanus	4	5	2590	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	To fright them ere destroy. But come in.
Coriolanus	4	5	2591	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Coriolanus	4	5	2592	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
Coriolanus	4	5	2593	speech	verse	Aufidius_Cor	And more a friend than ere an enemy—

Coriolanus	4	5	2598	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him.
Coriolanus	4	5	2599	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	What an arm he has! He turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top.
Coriolanus	4	5	2600	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him. He had, sir, a kind of face, methought—I cannot tell how to term it.
Coriolanus	4	5	2601	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	He had so, looking as it were— Would I were hanged but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
Coriolanus	4	5	2602	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	So did I, I’ll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i’ th’ world.
Coriolanus	4	5	2603	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	I think he is. But a greater soldier than he you wot one.
Coriolanus	4	5	2604	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Who, my master?
Coriolanus	4	5	2605	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Nay, it’s no matter for that.
Coriolanus	4	5	2606	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Worth six on him.
Coriolanus	4	5	2607	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Nay, not so neither. But I take him to be the greater soldier.
Coriolanus	4	5	2608	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that. For the defense of a town our general is excellent.

Coriolanus	4	5	2613	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as lief be a condemned man.
Coriolanus	4	5	2614	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Wherefore? Wherefore?
Coriolanus	4	5	2614	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Wherefore? Wherefore?
Coriolanus	4	5	2615	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	Why, here’s he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Martius.
Coriolanus	4	5	2616	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Why do you say “thwack our general”?
Coriolanus	4	5	2617	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	I do not say “thwack our general,” but he was always good enough for him.
Coriolanus	4	5	2618	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
Coriolanus	4	5	2619	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	He was too hard for him directly, to say the truth on ’t, before Corioles; he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado.
Coriolanus	4	5	2620	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	An he had been cannibally given, he might have boiled and eaten him too.
Coriolanus	4	5	2621	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	But, more of thy news.
Coriolanus	4	5	2622	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o’ th’ table; no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with ’s hand, and turns up the white o’ th’ eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i’ th’ middle and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He’ll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th’ ears. He will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled.
Coriolanus	4	5	2623	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	And he’s as like to do ’t as any man I can imagine.
Coriolanus	4	5	2624	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	Do ’t? He will do ’t! For, look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies, which friends, sir, as it were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as we term it, his friends whilest he’s in directitude.
Coriolanus	4	5	2625	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Directitude? What’s that?
Coriolanus	4	5	2626	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows like coneys after rain, and revel all with him.
Coriolanus	4	5	2627	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	But when goes this forward?
Coriolanus	4	5	2628	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	Tomorrow, today, presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon. ’Tis, as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.
Coriolanus	4	5	2629	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	Why then, we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
Coriolanus	4	5	2630	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Let me have war, say I. It exceeds peace as far as day does night. It’s sprightly walking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war’s a destroyer of men.
Coriolanus	4	5	2631	speech	prose	SERVANTS.2_Cor	’Tis so, and as wars in some sort may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.
Coriolanus	4	5	2632	speech	prose	SERVANTS.1_Cor	Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
Coriolanus	4	5	2633	speech	prose	SERVANTS.3_Cor	Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money! I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.

Coriolanus	5	2	3012	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I tell thee, fellow,
Coriolanus	5	2	3013	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Thy general is my lover. I have been
Coriolanus	5	2	3014	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	The book of his good acts, whence men have read
Coriolanus	5	2	3015	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	His fame unparalleled happily amplified;
Coriolanus	5	2	3016	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	For I have ever verified my friends—
Coriolanus	5	2	3017	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Of whom he’s chief—with all the size that verity
Coriolanus	5	2	3018	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,
Coriolanus	5	2	3019	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
Coriolanus	5	2	3020	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
Coriolanus	5	2	3021	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	Have almost stamped the leasing. Therefore, fellow,
Coriolanus	5	2	3022	speech	verse	Menenius_Cor	I must have leave to pass.
Coriolanus	5	2	3023	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.1_Cor	Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
Coriolanus	5	2	3024	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.
Coriolanus	5	2	3025	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.2_Cor	Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.

Coriolanus	5	2	3028	speech	prose	Menenius_Cor	I am, as thy general is.
Coriolanus	5	2	3029	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.1_Cor	Then you should hate Rome as he does. Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and, in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived. Therefore, back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemned. Our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.
