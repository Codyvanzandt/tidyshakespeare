Richard III	1	1	2	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Now is the winter of our discontent
Richard III	1	1	3	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Made glorious summer by this son of York,
Richard III	1	1	4	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And all the clouds that loured upon our house
Richard III	1	1	5	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Richard III	1	1	6	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
Richard III	1	1	7	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Our bruisèd arms hung up for monuments,
Richard III	1	1	8	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Richard III	1	1	9	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Richard III	1	1	10	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;
Richard III	1	1	11	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And now, instead of mounting barbèd steeds
Richard III	1	1	12	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
Richard III	1	1	13	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber
Richard III	1	1	14	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
Richard III	1	1	15	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Richard III	1	1	16	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;
Richard III	1	1	17	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I, that am rudely stamped and want love’s majesty
Richard III	1	1	18	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
Richard III	1	1	19	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,
Richard III	1	1	20	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Richard III	1	1	21	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time
Richard III	1	1	22	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
Richard III	1	1	23	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And that so lamely and unfashionable
Richard III	1	1	24	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That dogs bark at me as I halt by them—
Richard III	1	1	25	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Richard III	1	1	26	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Have no delight to pass away the time,
Richard III	1	1	27	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Unless to see my shadow in the sun
Richard III	1	1	28	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And descant on mine own deformity.
Richard III	1	1	29	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
Richard III	1	1	30	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
Richard III	1	1	31	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I am determinèd to prove a villain
Richard III	1	1	32	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Richard III	1	1	33	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
Richard III	1	1	34	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
Richard III	1	1	35	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To set my brother Clarence and the King
Richard III	1	1	36	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	In deadly hate, the one against the other;
Richard III	1	1	37	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And if King Edward be as true and just
Richard III	1	1	38	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
Richard III	1	1	39	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	This day should Clarence closely be mewed up
Richard III	1	1	40	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	About a prophecy which says that “G”
Richard III	1	1	41	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.
Richard III	1	1	42	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.

Richard III	1	1	43	direction	entrance	Brakenbury_R3	Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury.
Richard III	1	1	43	direction	entrance	GUARDS_R3	Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury.
Richard III	1	1	44	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Brother, good day. What means this armèd guard
Richard III	1	1	45	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That waits upon your Grace?
Richard III	1	1	46	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	His Majesty,
Richard III	1	1	47	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed
Richard III	1	1	48	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
Richard III	1	1	49	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Upon what cause?
Richard III	1	1	50	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Because my name is George.
Richard III	1	1	51	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.
Richard III	1	1	52	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
Richard III	1	1	53	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
Richard III	1	1	54	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That you should be new christened in the Tower.
Richard III	1	1	55	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But what’s the matter, Clarence? May I know?
Richard III	1	1	56	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest
Richard III	1	1	57	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,
Richard III	1	1	58	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
Richard III	1	1	59	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And from the crossrow plucks the letter G,
Richard III	1	1	60	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And says a wizard told him that by “G”
Richard III	1	1	61	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	His issue disinherited should be.
Richard III	1	1	62	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And for my name of George begins with G,
Richard III	1	1	63	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	It follows in his thought that I am he.
Richard III	1	1	64	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Richard III	1	1	65	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Hath moved his Highness to commit me now.
Richard III	1	1	66	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
Richard III	1	1	67	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower.
Richard III	1	1	68	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she
Richard III	1	1	69	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That tempers him to this extremity.
Richard III	1	1	70	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Richard III	1	1	71	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Anthony Woodeville, her brother there,
Richard III	1	1	72	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
Richard III	1	1	73	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	From whence this present day he is delivered?
Richard III	1	1	74	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
Richard III	1	1	75	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	By heaven, I think there is no man secure
Richard III	1	1	76	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	But the Queen’s kindred and night-walking heralds
Richard III	1	1	77	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
Richard III	1	1	78	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Heard you not what an humble suppliant
Richard III	1	1	79	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
Richard III	1	1	80	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Humbly complaining to her Deity
Richard III	1	1	81	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
Richard III	1	1	82	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I’ll tell you what: I think it is our way,
Richard III	1	1	83	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	If we will keep in favor with the King,
Richard III	1	1	84	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To be her men and wear her livery.
Richard III	1	1	85	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The jealous o’erworn widow and herself,
Richard III	1	1	86	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,
Richard III	1	1	87	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
Richard III	1	1	88	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.
Richard III	1	1	89	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
Richard III	1	1	90	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	That no man shall have private conference,
Richard III	1	1	91	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	Of what degree soever, with your brother.
Richard III	1	1	92	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Even so. An please your Worship, Brakenbury,
Richard III	1	1	93	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	You may partake of anything we say.
Richard III	1	1	94	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	We speak no treason, man. We say the King
Richard III	1	1	95	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Richard III	1	1	96	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
Richard III	1	1	97	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,
Richard III	1	1	98	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,
Richard III	1	1	99	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.
Richard III	1	1	100	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
Richard III	1	1	101	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
Richard III	1	1	102	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,
Richard III	1	1	103	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Richard III	1	1	104	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Were best to do it secretly, alone.
Richard III	1	1	105	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal
Richard III	1	1	106	speech	verse	Brakenbury_R3	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
Richard III	1	1	107	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
Richard III	1	1	108	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	We are the Queen’s abjects and must obey.—
Richard III	1	1	109	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Brother, farewell. I will unto the King,
Richard III	1	1	110	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,
Richard III	1	1	111	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Were it to call King Edward’s widow “sister,”
Richard III	1	1	112	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Richard III	1	1	113	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Richard III	1	1	114	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
Richard III	1	1	115	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Richard III	1	1	116	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.
Richard III	1	1	117	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I will deliver you or else lie for you.
Richard III	1	1	118	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Meantime, have patience.
Richard III	1	1	119	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	I must, perforce. Farewell.

Richard III	1	1	122	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
Richard III	1	1	123	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
Richard III	1	1	124	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	If heaven will take the present at our hands.

Richard III	1	1	127	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
Richard III	1	1	128	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.
Richard III	1	1	129	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Well are you welcome to the open air.
Richard III	1	1	130	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	How hath your Lordship brooked imprisonment?
Richard III	1	1	131	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
Richard III	1	1	132	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
Richard III	1	1	133	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	That were the cause of my imprisonment.
Richard III	1	1	134	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too,
Richard III	1	1	135	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	For they that were your enemies are his
Richard III	1	1	136	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And have prevailed as much on him as you.
Richard III	1	1	137	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	More pity that the eagles should be mewed,
Richard III	1	1	138	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
Richard III	1	1	139	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What news abroad?
Richard III	1	1	140	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	No news so bad abroad as this at home:
Richard III	1	1	141	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
Richard III	1	1	142	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	And his physicians fear him mightily.
Richard III	1	1	143	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
Richard III	1	1	144	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
Richard III	1	1	145	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And overmuch consumed his royal person.
Richard III	1	1	146	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
Richard III	1	1	147	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Where is he, in his bed?
Richard III	1	1	148	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	He is.
Richard III	1	1	149	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Go you before, and I will follow you.
Richard III	1	1	150	direction	exit	Hastings_3H6	Exit Hastings.
Richard III	1	1	151	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
Richard III	1	1	152	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.
Richard III	1	1	153	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
Richard III	1	1	154	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	With lies well steeled with weighty arguments,
Richard III	1	1	155	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
Richard III	1	1	156	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Clarence hath not another day to live;
Richard III	1	1	157	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Which done, God take King Edward to His mercy,
Richard III	1	1	158	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And leave the world for me to bustle in.
Richard III	1	1	159	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.
Richard III	1	1	160	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What though I killed her husband and her father?
Richard III	1	1	161	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The readiest way to make the wench amends
Richard III	1	1	162	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Is to become her husband and her father;
Richard III	1	1	163	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The which will I, not all so much for love
Richard III	1	1	164	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As for another secret close intent
Richard III	1	1	165	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	By marrying her which I must reach unto.
Richard III	1	1	166	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But yet I run before my horse to market.
Richard III	1	1	167	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.

Richard III	1	2	271	speech	verse	LadyAnne_R3	In thy foul throat thou liest. Queen Margaret saw

Richard III	1	2	286	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,
Richard III	1	2	287	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	For he was fitter for that place than Earth.
Richard III	1	2	288	speech	verse	LadyAnne_R3	And thou unfit for any place but hell.

Richard III	1	2	315	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	It is a quarrel most unnatural
Richard III	1	2	316	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To be revenged on him that loveth thee.
Richard III	1	2	317	speech	verse	LadyAnne_R3	It is a quarrel just and reasonable

Richard III	1	3	479	direction	delivery	Buckingham_R3	, to Queen Elizabeth
Richard III	1	3	480	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Good time of day unto your royal Grace.
Richard III	1	3	481	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.
Richard III	1	3	482	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	The Countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,
Richard III	1	3	483	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
Richard III	1	3	484	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife
Richard III	1	3	485	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
Richard III	1	3	486	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
Richard III	1	3	487	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	I do beseech you either not believe
Richard III	1	3	488	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	The envious slanders of her false accusers,
Richard III	1	3	489	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	Or if she be accused on true report,
Richard III	1	3	490	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
Richard III	1	3	491	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
Richard III	1	3	492	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Saw you the King today, my lord of Derby?
Richard III	1	3	493	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Richard III	1	3	494	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	Are come from visiting his Majesty.
Richard III	1	3	495	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
Richard III	1	3	496	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Madam, good hope. His Grace speaks cheerfully.
Richard III	1	3	497	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	God grant him health. Did you confer with him?
Richard III	1	3	498	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Ay, madam. He desires to make atonement
Richard III	1	3	499	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
Richard III	1	3	500	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And between them and my Lord Chamberlain,
Richard III	1	3	501	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
Richard III	1	3	502	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Would all were well—but that will never be.
Richard III	1	3	503	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	I fear our happiness is at the height.

Richard III	1	3	504	direction	entrance	Hastings_3H6	Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Hastings.
Richard III	1	3	505	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!
Richard III	1	3	506	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Who is it that complains unto the King
Richard III	1	3	507	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
Richard III	1	3	508	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
Richard III	1	3	509	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.
Richard III	1	3	510	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
Richard III	1	3	511	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
Richard III	1	3	512	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
Richard III	1	3	513	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Richard III	1	3	514	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
Richard III	1	3	515	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But thus his simple truth must be abused
Richard III	1	3	516	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
Richard III	1	3	517	speech	verse	Grey_R3	To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
Richard III	1	3	518	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
Richard III	1	3	519	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	When have I injured thee? When done thee wrong?—
Richard III	1	3	520	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Or thee?—Or thee? Or any of your faction?
Richard III	1	3	521	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	A plague upon you all! His royal Grace,
Richard III	1	3	522	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Whom God preserve better than you would wish,
Richard III	1	3	523	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while
Richard III	1	3	524	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
Richard III	1	3	525	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
Richard III	1	3	526	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	The King, on his own royal disposition,
Richard III	1	3	527	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	And not provoked by any suitor else,
Richard III	1	3	528	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Aiming belike at your interior hatred
Richard III	1	3	529	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	That in your outward action shows itself
Richard III	1	3	530	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Against my children, brothers, and myself,
Richard III	1	3	531	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.
Richard III	1	3	532	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad
Richard III	1	3	533	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
Richard III	1	3	534	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Since every Jack became a gentleman,
Richard III	1	3	535	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	There’s many a gentle person made a Jack.
Richard III	1	3	536	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.
Richard III	1	3	537	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	You envy my advancement, and my friends’.
Richard III	1	3	538	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	God grant we never may have need of you.
Richard III	1	3	539	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Meantime God grants that we have need of you.
Richard III	1	3	540	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Our brother is imprisoned by your means,
Richard III	1	3	541	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Richard III	1	3	542	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Held in contempt, while great promotions
Richard III	1	3	543	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Are daily given to ennoble those
Richard III	1	3	544	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
Richard III	1	3	545	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	By Him that raised me to this careful height
Richard III	1	3	546	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	From that contented hap which I enjoyed,
Richard III	1	3	547	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	I never did incense his Majesty
Richard III	1	3	548	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
Richard III	1	3	549	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	An earnest advocate to plead for him.
Richard III	1	3	550	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	My lord, you do me shameful injury
Richard III	1	3	551	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
Richard III	1	3	552	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	You may deny that you were not the mean
Richard III	1	3	553	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Of my Lord Hastings’ late imprisonment.
Richard III	1	3	554	speech	verse	Rivers_3H6	She may, my lord, for—
Richard III	1	3	555	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	She may, Lord Rivers. Why, who knows not so?
Richard III	1	3	556	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	She may do more, sir, than denying that.
Richard III	1	3	557	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	She may help you to many fair preferments
Richard III	1	3	558	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And then deny her aiding hand therein,
Richard III	1	3	559	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And lay those honors on your high desert.
Richard III	1	3	560	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What may she not? She may, ay, marry, may she—
Richard III	1	3	561	speech	verse	Rivers_3H6	What, marry, may she?
Richard III	1	3	562	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
Richard III	1	3	563	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
Richard III	1	3	564	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Iwis, your grandam had a worser match.
Richard III	1	3	565	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Richard III	1	3	566	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
Richard III	1	3	567	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
Richard III	1	3	568	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Of those gross taunts that oft I have endured.
Richard III	1	3	569	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	I had rather be a country servant-maid
Richard III	1	3	570	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Than a great queen with this condition,

Richard III	1	3	577	direction	delivery	RichardIII_R3	, to Queen Elizabeth
Richard III	1	3	578	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What, threat you me with telling of the King?
Richard III	1	3	579	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Tell him and spare not. Look, what I have said,
Richard III	1	3	580	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I will avouch ’t in presence of the King;
Richard III	1	3	581	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I dare adventure to be sent to th’ Tower.
Richard III	1	3	582	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Tis time to speak. My pains are quite forgot.

Richard III	1	3	587	direction	delivery	RichardIII_R3	, to Queen Elizabeth
Richard III	1	3	588	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,
Richard III	1	3	589	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I was a packhorse in his great affairs,
Richard III	1	3	590	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
Richard III	1	3	591	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	A liberal rewarder of his friends.
Richard III	1	3	592	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To royalize his blood, I spent mine own.

Richard III	1	3	596	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	In all which time, you and your husband Grey
Richard III	1	3	597	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Were factious for the House of Lancaster.—
Richard III	1	3	598	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And, Rivers, so were you.—Was not your husband
Richard III	1	3	599	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	In Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain?
Richard III	1	3	600	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Let me put in your minds, if you forget,

Richard III	1	3	606	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick,

Richard III	1	3	697	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And then hurl down their indignation
Richard III	1	3	698	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	On thee, the troubler of the poor world’s peace.
Richard III	1	3	699	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.
Richard III	1	3	700	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv’st,

Richard III	1	4	856	speech	verse	Jailer_R3	What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
Richard III	1	4	857	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
Richard III	1	4	858	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,
Richard III	1	4	859	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And in my company my brother Gloucester,
Richard III	1	4	860	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Richard III	1	4	861	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England

Richard III	1	4	863	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	During the wars of York and Lancaster,

Richard III	1	4	868	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Into the tumbling billows of the main.

Richard III	1	4	886	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth
Richard III	1	4	887	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,
Richard III	1	4	888	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	But smothered it within my panting bulk,

Richard III	1	4	890	speech	verse	Jailer_R3	Awaked you not in this sore agony?
Richard III	1	4	891	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.
Richard III	1	4	892	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	O, then began the tempest to my soul.
Richard III	1	4	893	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,

Richard III	1	4	895	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.

Richard III	1	4	901	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Richard III	1	4	902	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked out aloud
Richard III	1	4	903	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	“Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,

Richard III	1	4	952	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	No. He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Richard III	1	4	953	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.
Richard III	1	4	954	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.
Richard III	1	4	955	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
Richard III	1	4	956	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	What, art thou afraid?
Richard III	1	4	957	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
Richard III	1	4	958	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
Richard III	1	4	959	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	So I am—to let him live.
Richard III	1	4	960	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	I’ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
Richard III	1	4	961	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humor of mine will change. It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.
Richard III	1	4	962	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	How dost thou feel thyself now?
Richard III	1	4	963	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
Richard III	1	4	964	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	Remember our reward when the deed’s done.
Richard III	1	4	965	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Zounds, he dies! I had forgot the reward.

Richard III	1	4	968	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
Richard III	1	4	969	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	’Tis no matter. Let it go. There’s few or none will entertain it.
Richard III	1	4	970	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	What if it come to thee again?
Richard III	1	4	971	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	I’ll not meddle with it. It makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbor’s wife but it detects him. ’Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom. It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing, and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.
Richard III	1	4	972	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	Zounds, ’tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the Duke.
Richard III	1	4	973	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not. He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

Richard III	1	4	978	speech	prose	MURDERERS.1_R3	Soft, he wakes.
Richard III	1	4	979	speech	prose	MURDERERS.2_R3	Strike!

Richard III	1	4	989	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	My voice is now the King’s, my looks mine own.
Richard III	1	4	990	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Richard III	1	4	991	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
Richard III	1	4	992	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

Richard III	1	4	995	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	Ay, ay.
Richard III	1	4	995	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	Ay, ay.
Richard III	1	4	996	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
Richard III	1	4	997	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Richard III	1	4	998	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

Richard III	1	4	1001	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	Never, my lord. Therefore prepare to die.
Richard III	1	4	1002	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Are you drawn forth among a world of men
Richard III	1	4	1003	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	To slay the innocent? What is my offense?
Richard III	1	4	1004	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
Richard III	1	4	1005	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Richard III	1	4	1006	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Unto the frowning judge? Or who pronounced
Richard III	1	4	1007	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death
Richard III	1	4	1008	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Before I be convict by course of law?
Richard III	1	4	1009	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
Richard III	1	4	1010	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption,
Richard III	1	4	1011	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
Richard III	1	4	1012	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	That you depart, and lay no hands on me.
Richard III	1	4	1013	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	The deed you undertake is damnable.
Richard III	1	4	1014	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	What we will do, we do upon command.

Richard III	1	4	1019	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Spurn at His edict and fulfill a man’s?
Richard III	1	4	1020	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand
Richard III	1	4	1021	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	To hurl upon their heads that break His law.
Richard III	1	4	1022	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee
Richard III	1	4	1023	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	For false forswearing and for murder too.
Richard III	1	4	1024	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
Richard III	1	4	1025	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	In quarrel of the House of Lancaster.
Richard III	1	4	1026	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Richard III	1	4	1027	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade
Richard III	1	4	1028	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son.
Richard III	1	4	1029	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_R3	Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.
Richard III	1	4	1030	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_R3	How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us

Richard III	1	4	1034	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	He sends you not to murder me for this,
Richard III	1	4	1035	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	For in that sin he is as deep as I.

Richard III	1	4	1038	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm;
Richard III	1	4	1039	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	He needs no indirect or lawless course
Richard III	1	4	1040	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	To cut off those that have offended Him.

Richard III	2	3	1460	speech	verse	CITIZENS.3_R3	Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
Richard III	2	3	1461	speech	verse	CITIZENS.1_R3	Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.
Richard III	2	3	1462	speech	verse	CITIZENS.3_R3	Better it were they all came by his father,

Richard III	2	4	1493	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
Richard III	2	4	1494	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	But I hear no; they say my son of York

Richard III	2	4	1496	speech	verse	York_R3	Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.
Richard III	2	4	1497	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	Why, my good cousin? It is good to grow.
Richard III	2	4	1498	speech	verse	York_R3	Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
Richard III	2	4	1499	speech	verse	York_R3	My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow
Richard III	2	4	1500	speech	verse	York_R3	More than my brother. “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester,
Richard III	2	4	1501	speech	verse	York_R3	“Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.”
Richard III	2	4	1502	speech	verse	York_R3	And since, methinks I would not grow so fast
Richard III	2	4	1503	speech	verse	York_R3	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
Richard III	2	4	1504	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
Richard III	2	4	1505	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	In him that did object the same to thee!
Richard III	2	4	1506	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,
Richard III	2	4	1507	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	So long a-growing and so leisurely,
Richard III	2	4	1508	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	That if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
Richard III	2	4	1509	speech	verse	York_R3	And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
Richard III	2	4	1510	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.
Richard III	2	4	1511	speech	verse	York_R3	Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered,
Richard III	2	4	1512	speech	verse	York_R3	I could have given my uncle’s Grace a flout
Richard III	2	4	1513	speech	verse	York_R3	To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.
Richard III	2	4	1514	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
Richard III	2	4	1515	speech	verse	York_R3	Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
Richard III	2	4	1516	speech	verse	York_R3	That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
Richard III	2	4	1517	speech	verse	York_R3	’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Richard III	2	4	1518	speech	verse	York_R3	Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
Richard III	2	4	1519	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R3	I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
Richard III	2	4	1520	speech	verse	York_R3	Grandam, his nurse.

Richard III	3	1	1604	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	But by his mother was perforce withheld.
Richard III	3	1	1605	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Fie, what an indirect and peevish course

Richard III	3	1	1618	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	You are too senseless obstinate, my lord,

Richard III	3	1	1620	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,

Richard III	3	1	1625	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it
Richard III	3	1	1626	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.

Richard III	3	2	1803	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	What then?

Richard III	3	2	1819	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.
Richard III	3	2	1820	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple
Richard III	3	2	1821	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers.
Richard III	3	2	1822	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	To fly the boar before the boar pursues

Richard III	3	2	1833	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	What news, what news in this our tott’ring state?
Richard III	3	2	1834	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,
Richard III	3	2	1835	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	And I believe will never stand upright
Richard III	3	2	1836	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
Richard III	3	2	1837	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	How “wear the garland”? Dost thou mean the crown?
Richard III	3	2	1838	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	Ay, my good lord.
Richard III	3	2	1839	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Richard III	3	2	1840	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced.
Richard III	3	2	1841	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
Richard III	3	2	1842	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward
Richard III	3	2	1843	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	Upon his party for the gain thereof;
Richard III	3	2	1844	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	And thereupon he sends you this good news,
Richard III	3	2	1845	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	That this same very day your enemies,
Richard III	3	2	1846	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
Richard III	3	2	1847	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Richard III	3	2	1848	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Because they have been still my adversaries.
Richard III	3	2	1849	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side

Richard III	3	2	1851	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	God knows I will not do it, to the death.
Richard III	3	2	1852	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.
Richard III	3	2	1853	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,

Richard III	3	2	1855	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	I live to look upon their tragedy.
Richard III	3	2	1856	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older
Richard III	3	2	1857	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t.
Richard III	3	2	1858	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	’Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
Richard III	3	2	1859	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	When men are unprepared and look not for it.
Richard III	3	2	1860	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
Richard III	3	2	1861	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do
Richard III	3	2	1862	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	With some men else that think themselves as safe
Richard III	3	2	1863	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	As thou and I, who, as thou know’st, are dear

Richard III	3	2	1865	speech	verse	Catesby_R3	The Princes both make high account of you—

Richard III	3	2	1872	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	My lord, good morrow.—Good morrow, Catesby.—
Richard III	3	2	1873	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood,
Richard III	3	2	1874	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	I do not like these several councils, I.
Richard III	3	2	1875	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours,
Richard III	3	2	1876	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	And never in my days, I do protest,
Richard III	3	2	1877	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Was it so precious to me as ’tis now.
Richard III	3	2	1878	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Think you but that I know our state secure,
Richard III	3	2	1879	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	I would be so triumphant as I am?
Richard III	3	2	1880	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Richard III	3	2	1881	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	Were jocund and supposed their states were sure,
Richard III	3	2	1882	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
Richard III	3	2	1883	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	But yet you see how soon the day o’ercast.
Richard III	3	2	1884	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt.

Richard III	3	2	1889	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
Richard III	3	2	1890	speech	verse	Stanley_R3	Than some that have accused them wear their hats.

Richard III	3	2	1898	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.

Richard III	3	2	1900	speech	verse	Hastings_3H6	By the suggestion of the Queen’s allies.

Richard III	3	7	2217	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And his contract by deputy in France;
Richard III	3	7	2218	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Th’ unsatiate greediness of his desire
Richard III	3	7	2219	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And his enforcement of the city wives;
Richard III	3	7	2220	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
Richard III	3	7	2221	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	As being got, your father then in France,
Richard III	3	7	2222	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And his resemblance being not like the Duke.
Richard III	3	7	2223	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Withal, I did infer your lineaments,
Richard III	3	7	2224	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Being the right idea of your father,
Richard III	3	7	2225	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Richard III	3	7	2226	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Richard III	3	7	2227	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Richard III	3	7	2228	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
Richard III	3	7	2229	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
Richard III	3	7	2230	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.
Richard III	3	7	2231	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And when mine oratory drew toward end,
Richard III	3	7	2232	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	I bid them that did love their country’s good
Richard III	3	7	2233	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Cry “God save Richard, England’s royal king!”
Richard III	3	7	2234	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And did they so?
Richard III	3	7	2235	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	No. So God help me, they spake not a word
Richard III	3	7	2236	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Richard III	3	7	2237	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Stared each on other and looked deadly pale;
Richard III	3	7	2238	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Which when I saw, I reprehended them
Richard III	3	7	2239	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And asked the Mayor what meant this willful silence.
Richard III	3	7	2240	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	His answer was, the people were not used
Richard III	3	7	2241	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
Richard III	3	7	2242	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Then he was urged to tell my tale again:
Richard III	3	7	2243	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	“Thus saith the Duke. Thus hath the Duke inferred”—
Richard III	3	7	2244	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
Richard III	3	7	2245	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	When he had done, some followers of mine own,
Richard III	3	7	2246	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	At lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,
Richard III	3	7	2247	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And some ten voices cried “God save King Richard!”
Richard III	3	7	2248	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And thus I took the vantage of those few.
Richard III	3	7	2249	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I.
Richard III	3	7	2250	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	“This general applause and cheerful shout
Richard III	3	7	2251	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard”—
Richard III	3	7	2252	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And even here brake off and came away.
Richard III	3	7	2253	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What tongueless blocks were they! Would they not speak?
Richard III	3	7	2254	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
Richard III	3	7	2255	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
Richard III	3	7	2256	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit.
Richard III	3	7	2257	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And look you get a prayer book in your hand
Richard III	3	7	2258	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And stand between two churchmen, good my lord,
Richard III	3	7	2259	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant.
Richard III	3	7	2260	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	And be not easily won to our requests.
Richard III	3	7	2261	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Play the maid’s part: still answer “nay,” and take it.
Richard III	3	7	2262	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I go. An if you plead as well for them
Richard III	3	7	2263	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As I can say “nay” to thee for myself,

Richard III	3	7	2360	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I cannot tell if to depart in silence
Richard III	3	7	2361	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
Richard III	3	7	2362	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Best fitteth my degree or your condition.

Richard III	3	7	2364	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
Richard III	3	7	2365	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Richard III	3	7	2366	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Which fondly you would here impose on me.

Richard III	3	7	2368	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	So seasoned with your faithful love to me,
Richard III	3	7	2369	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Then on the other side I checked my friends.
Richard III	3	7	2370	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
Richard III	3	7	2371	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Richard III	3	7	2372	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Definitively thus I answer you:
Richard III	3	7	2373	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
Richard III	3	7	2374	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Unmeritable shuns your high request.
Richard III	3	7	2375	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	First, if all obstacles were cut away
Richard III	3	7	2376	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And that my path were even to the crown
Richard III	3	7	2377	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
Richard III	3	7	2378	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
Richard III	3	7	2379	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	So mighty and so many my defects,
Richard III	3	7	2380	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That I would rather hide me from my greatness,
Richard III	3	7	2381	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Richard III	3	7	2382	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Than in my greatness covet to be hid
Richard III	3	7	2383	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And in the vapor of my glory smothered.
Richard III	3	7	2384	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,
Richard III	3	7	2385	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And much I need to help you, were there need.
Richard III	3	7	2386	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Richard III	3	7	2387	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,
Richard III	3	7	2388	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Will well become the seat of majesty,
Richard III	3	7	2389	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.

Richard III	3	7	2391	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The right and fortune of his happy stars,
Richard III	3	7	2392	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Which God defend that I should wring from him.
Richard III	3	7	2393	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,
Richard III	3	7	2394	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
Richard III	3	7	2395	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	All circumstances well considerèd.
Richard III	3	7	2396	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	You say that Edward is your brother’s son;

Richard III	3	7	2401	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	To Bona, sister to the King of France.
Richard III	3	7	2402	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	These both put off, a poor petitioner,

Richard III	3	7	2408	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	To base declension and loathed bigamy.
Richard III	3	7	2409	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	By her in his unlawful bed he got
Richard III	3	7	2410	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	This Edward, whom our manners call “the Prince.”
Richard III	3	7	2411	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	More bitterly could I expostulate,
Richard III	3	7	2412	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Save that, for reverence to some alive,
Richard III	3	7	2413	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Richard III	3	7	2414	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
Richard III	3	7	2415	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	This proffered benefit of dignity,
Richard III	3	7	2416	speech	verse	Buckingham_R3	If not to bless us and the land withal,

Richard III	4	4	3119	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
Richard III	4	4	3120	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Look what is done cannot be now amended.
Richard III	4	4	3121	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Richard III	4	4	3122	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
Richard III	4	4	3123	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
Richard III	4	4	3124	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter.
Richard III	4	4	3125	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	If I have killed the issue of your womb,
Richard III	4	4	3126	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To quicken your increase I will beget
Richard III	4	4	3127	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
Richard III	4	4	3128	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	A grandam’s name is little less in love
Richard III	4	4	3129	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Than is the doting title of a mother.
Richard III	4	4	3130	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	They are as children but one step below,
Richard III	4	4	3131	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Even of your metal, of your very blood,
Richard III	4	4	3132	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
Richard III	4	4	3133	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow.
Richard III	4	4	3134	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Your children were vexation to your youth,
Richard III	4	4	3135	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
Richard III	4	4	3136	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The loss you have is but a son being king,
Richard III	4	4	3137	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
Richard III	4	4	3138	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I cannot make you what amends I would;
Richard III	4	4	3139	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Richard III	4	4	3140	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Richard III	4	4	3141	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
Richard III	4	4	3142	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
Richard III	4	4	3143	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To high promotions and great dignity.
Richard III	4	4	3144	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
Richard III	4	4	3145	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother.
Richard III	4	4	3146	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Again shall you be mother to a king,
Richard III	4	4	3147	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And all the ruins of distressful times
Richard III	4	4	3148	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Repaired with double riches of content.
Richard III	4	4	3149	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What, we have many goodly days to see!
Richard III	4	4	3150	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Richard III	4	4	3151	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,
Richard III	4	4	3152	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Advantaging their love with interest
Richard III	4	4	3153	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Richard III	4	4	3154	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go.
Richard III	4	4	3155	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Richard III	4	4	3156	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale;
Richard III	4	4	3157	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame
Richard III	4	4	3158	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess
Richard III	4	4	3159	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys;
Richard III	4	4	3160	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And when this arm of mine hath chastisèd
Richard III	4	4	3161	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham,
Richard III	4	4	3162	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
Richard III	4	4	3163	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed,
Richard III	4	4	3164	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
Richard III	4	4	3165	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar’s Caesar.
Richard III	4	4	3166	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	What were I best to say? Her father’s brother
Richard III	4	4	3167	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
Richard III	4	4	3168	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Richard III	4	4	3169	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Under what title shall I woo for thee,
Richard III	4	4	3170	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	That God, the law, my honor, and her love
Richard III	4	4	3171	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
Richard III	4	4	3172	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance.
Richard III	4	4	3173	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.
Richard III	4	4	3174	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Tell her the King, that may command, entreats—
Richard III	4	4	3175	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	That, at her hands, which the King’s King forbids.
Richard III	4	4	3176	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
Richard III	4	4	3177	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	To vail the title, as her mother doth.
Richard III	4	4	3178	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Say I will love her everlastingly.
Richard III	4	4	3179	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	But how long shall that title “ever” last?
Richard III	4	4	3180	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end.
Richard III	4	4	3181	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?
Richard III	4	4	3182	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
Richard III	4	4	3183	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
Richard III	4	4	3184	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
Richard III	4	4	3185	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
Richard III	4	4	3186	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
Richard III	4	4	3187	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
Richard III	4	4	3188	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
Richard III	4	4	3189	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
Richard III	4	4	3190	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
Richard III	4	4	3191	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	O no, my reasons are too deep and dead—
Richard III	4	4	3192	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
Richard III	4	4	3193	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
Richard III	4	4	3194	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
Richard III	4	4	3195	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown—
Richard III	4	4	3196	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.
Richard III	4	4	3197	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I swear—
Richard III	4	4	3198	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	By nothing, for this is no oath.
Richard III	4	4	3199	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor;
Richard III	4	4	3200	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thy Garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;
Richard III	4	4	3201	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.
Richard III	4	4	3202	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,
Richard III	4	4	3203	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.
Richard III	4	4	3204	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Then, by myself—
Richard III	4	4	3205	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thyself is self-misused.
Richard III	4	4	3206	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Now, by the world—
Richard III	4	4	3207	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	’Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
Richard III	4	4	3208	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	My father’s death—
Richard III	4	4	3209	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thy life hath it dishonored.
Richard III	4	4	3210	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Why then, by God.
Richard III	4	4	3211	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	God’s wrong is most of all.
Richard III	4	4	3212	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,
Richard III	4	4	3213	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	The unity the King my husband made
Richard III	4	4	3214	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
Richard III	4	4	3215	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,
Richard III	4	4	3216	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Th’ imperial metal circling now thy head
Richard III	4	4	3217	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Had graced the tender temples of my child,
Richard III	4	4	3218	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	And both the Princes had been breathing here,
Richard III	4	4	3219	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
Richard III	4	4	3220	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
Richard III	4	4	3221	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	What canst thou swear by now?
Richard III	4	4	3222	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The time to come.
Richard III	4	4	3223	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	That thou hast wrongèd in the time o’erpast;
Richard III	4	4	3224	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	For I myself have many tears to wash
Richard III	4	4	3225	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.
Richard III	4	4	3226	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered,
Richard III	4	4	3227	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age;
Richard III	4	4	3228	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	The parents live whose children thou hast butchered,
Richard III	4	4	3229	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
Richard III	4	4	3230	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast
Richard III	4	4	3231	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Misused ere used, by times ill-used o’erpast.
Richard III	4	4	3232	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As I intend to prosper and repent,
Richard III	4	4	3233	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
Richard III	4	4	3234	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound,
Richard III	4	4	3235	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours,
Richard III	4	4	3236	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest,
Richard III	4	4	3237	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Be opposite all planets of good luck

Richard III	4	4	3240	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
Richard III	4	4	3241	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	In her consists my happiness and thine.
Richard III	4	4	3242	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Without her follows to myself and thee,
Richard III	4	4	3243	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
Richard III	4	4	3244	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
Richard III	4	4	3245	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	It cannot be avoided but by this;
Richard III	4	4	3246	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	It will not be avoided but by this.
Richard III	4	4	3247	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Therefore, dear mother—I must call you so—
Richard III	4	4	3248	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Be the attorney of my love to her;
Richard III	4	4	3249	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Richard III	4	4	3250	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
Richard III	4	4	3251	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Urge the necessity and state of times,
Richard III	4	4	3252	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And be not peevish found in great designs.
Richard III	4	4	3253	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
Richard III	4	4	3254	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.

Richard III	4	4	3260	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
Richard III	4	4	3261	speech	verse	QueenElizabeth_3H6	Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
Richard III	4	4	3262	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And be a happy mother by the deed.
