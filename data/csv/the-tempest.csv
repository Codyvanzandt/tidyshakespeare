The Tempest	1	1	17	speech	prose	Boatswain_Tmp	None that I more love than myself. You are a councillor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say!
The Tempest	1	1	18	direction	exit	Boatswain_Tmp	He exits.
The Tempest	1	1	19	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him. His complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

The Tempest	1	1	28	speech	prose	Boatswain_Tmp	Work you, then.
The Tempest	1	1	29	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
The Tempest	1	1	30	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	I’ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
The Tempest	1	1	31	speech	prose	Boatswain_Tmp	Lay her ahold, ahold! Set her two courses. Off to sea again! Lay her off!

The Tempest	1	1	37	speech	prose	Sebastian_Tmp	I am out of patience.
The Tempest	1	1	38	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards. This wide-chopped rascal—would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!
The Tempest	1	1	39	direction	exit	Boatswain_Tmp	Boatswain exits.
The Tempest	1	1	40	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at wid’st to glut him.
The Tempest	1	1	41	direction	business		A confused noise within:
The Tempest	1	1	42	speech	prose		“Mercy on us!”—“We split, we split!”—“Farewell, my wife and children!”— “Farewell, brother!”—“We split, we split, we split!”

The Tempest	1	1	45	direction	exit	Antonio_Tmp	He exits with Antonio.
The Tempest	1	1	46	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done, but I would fain die a dry death.

The Tempest	1	2	50	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The Tempest	1	2	51	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
The Tempest	1	2	52	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,
The Tempest	1	2	53	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
The Tempest	1	2	54	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,
The Tempest	1	2	55	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
The Tempest	1	2	56	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
The Tempest	1	2	57	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.
The Tempest	1	2	58	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Had I been any god of power, I would
The Tempest	1	2	59	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
The Tempest	1	2	60	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	It should the good ship so have swallowed, and
The Tempest	1	2	61	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	The fraughting souls within her.
The Tempest	1	2	62	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Be collected.
The Tempest	1	2	63	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
The Tempest	1	2	64	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	There’s no harm done.
The Tempest	1	2	65	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	O, woe the day!
The Tempest	1	2	66	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	No harm.
The Tempest	1	2	67	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I have done nothing but in care of thee,
The Tempest	1	2	68	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
The Tempest	1	2	69	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing
The Tempest	1	2	70	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
The Tempest	1	2	71	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
The Tempest	1	2	72	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And thy no greater father.
The Tempest	1	2	73	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	More to know
The Tempest	1	2	74	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Did never meddle with my thoughts.
The Tempest	1	2	75	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	’Tis time
The Tempest	1	2	76	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand
The Tempest	1	2	77	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And pluck my magic garment from me.
The Tempest	1	2	78	direction	business	Prospero_Tmp	Putting aside his cloak.
The Tempest	1	2	79	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	So,
The Tempest	1	2	80	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort.
The Tempest	1	2	81	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched
The Tempest	1	2	82	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The very virtue of compassion in thee,
The Tempest	1	2	83	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I have with such provision in mine art
The Tempest	1	2	84	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	So safely ordered that there is no soul—
The Tempest	1	2	85	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	No, not so much perdition as an hair,
The Tempest	1	2	86	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Betid to any creature in the vessel
The Tempest	1	2	87	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down,
The Tempest	1	2	88	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	For thou must now know farther.
The Tempest	1	2	89	direction	business	Prospero_Tmp	They sit.
The Tempest	1	2	89	direction	business	Miranda_Tmp	They sit.
The Tempest	1	2	90	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	You have often
The Tempest	1	2	91	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped
The Tempest	1	2	92	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	And left me to a bootless inquisition,
The Tempest	1	2	93	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Concluding “Stay. Not yet.”
The Tempest	1	2	94	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The hour’s now come.
The Tempest	1	2	95	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.
The Tempest	1	2	96	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
The Tempest	1	2	97	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A time before we came unto this cell?
The Tempest	1	2	98	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
The Tempest	1	2	99	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Out three years old.
The Tempest	1	2	100	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Certainly, sir, I can.
The Tempest	1	2	101	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	By what? By any other house or person?
The Tempest	1	2	102	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of anything the image tell me that
The Tempest	1	2	103	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Hath kept with thy remembrance.
The Tempest	1	2	104	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	’Tis far off
The Tempest	1	2	105	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	And rather like a dream than an assurance
The Tempest	1	2	106	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
The Tempest	1	2	107	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Four or five women once that tended me?
The Tempest	1	2	108	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
The Tempest	1	2	109	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
The Tempest	1	2	110	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	In the dark backward and abysm of time?
The Tempest	1	2	111	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,
The Tempest	1	2	112	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	How thou cam’st here thou mayst.
The Tempest	1	2	113	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	But that I do not.
The Tempest	1	2	114	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
The Tempest	1	2	115	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
The Tempest	1	2	116	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A prince of power.
The Tempest	1	2	117	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Sir, are not you my father?
The Tempest	1	2	118	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
The Tempest	1	2	119	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father
The Tempest	1	2	120	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir
The Tempest	1	2	121	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And princess no worse issued.
The Tempest	1	2	122	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	O, the heavens!
The Tempest	1	2	123	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	What foul play had we that we came from thence?
The Tempest	1	2	124	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Or blessèd was ’t we did?
The Tempest	1	2	125	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Both, both, my girl.
The Tempest	1	2	126	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,
The Tempest	1	2	127	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	But blessedly holp hither.
The Tempest	1	2	128	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	O, my heart bleeds
The Tempest	1	2	129	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	To think o’ th’ teen that I have turned you to,
The Tempest	1	2	130	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.
The Tempest	1	2	131	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio—
The Tempest	1	2	132	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should
The Tempest	1	2	133	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself
The Tempest	1	2	134	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of all the world I loved, and to him put
The Tempest	1	2	135	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The manage of my state, as at that time
The Tempest	1	2	136	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Through all the signories it was the first,
The Tempest	1	2	137	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
The Tempest	1	2	138	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	In dignity, and for the liberal arts
The Tempest	1	2	139	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Without a parallel. Those being all my study,
The Tempest	1	2	140	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The government I cast upon my brother
The Tempest	1	2	141	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And to my state grew stranger, being transported
The Tempest	1	2	142	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—
The Tempest	1	2	143	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Dost thou attend me?
The Tempest	1	2	144	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Sir, most heedfully.
The Tempest	1	2	145	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Being once perfected how to grant suits,
The Tempest	1	2	146	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who
The Tempest	1	2	147	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To trash for overtopping, new created
The Tempest	1	2	148	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,
The Tempest	1	2	149	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Or else new formed ’em, having both the key
The Tempest	1	2	150	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state
The Tempest	1	2	151	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was
The Tempest	1	2	152	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
The Tempest	1	2	153	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.
The Tempest	1	2	154	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	O, good sir, I do.
The Tempest	1	2	155	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I pray thee, mark me.
The Tempest	1	2	156	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
The Tempest	1	2	157	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To closeness and the bettering of my mind
The Tempest	1	2	158	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	With that which, but by being so retired,
The Tempest	1	2	159	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	O’erprized all popular rate, in my false brother
The Tempest	1	2	160	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,
The Tempest	1	2	161	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Like a good parent, did beget of him
The Tempest	1	2	162	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A falsehood in its contrary as great
The Tempest	1	2	163	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,
The Tempest	1	2	164	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
The Tempest	1	2	165	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Not only with what my revenue yielded
The Tempest	1	2	166	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	But what my power might else exact, like one
The Tempest	1	2	167	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Who, having into truth by telling of it,
The Tempest	1	2	168	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Made such a sinner of his memory
The Tempest	1	2	169	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To credit his own lie, he did believe
The Tempest	1	2	170	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution
The Tempest	1	2	171	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And executing th’ outward face of royalty
The Tempest	1	2	172	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	With all prerogative. Hence, his ambition growing—
The Tempest	1	2	173	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Dost thou hear?
The Tempest	1	2	174	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
The Tempest	1	2	175	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To have no screen between this part he played
The Tempest	1	2	176	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And him he played it for, he needs will be
The Tempest	1	2	177	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
The Tempest	1	2	178	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties
The Tempest	1	2	179	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	He thinks me now incapable; confederates,
The Tempest	1	2	180	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	So dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples
The Tempest	1	2	181	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
The Tempest	1	2	182	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
The Tempest	1	2	183	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The dukedom, yet unbowed—alas, poor Milan!—
The Tempest	1	2	184	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To most ignoble stooping.
The Tempest	1	2	185	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	O, the heavens!
The Tempest	1	2	186	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Mark his condition and th’ event. Then tell me
The Tempest	1	2	187	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	If this might be a brother.
The Tempest	1	2	188	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	I should sin
The Tempest	1	2	189	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	To think but nobly of my grandmother.
The Tempest	1	2	190	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Good wombs have borne bad sons.
The Tempest	1	2	191	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Now the condition.
The Tempest	1	2	192	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	This King of Naples, being an enemy
The Tempest	1	2	193	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,
The Tempest	1	2	194	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Which was that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises
The Tempest	1	2	195	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
The Tempest	1	2	196	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Should presently extirpate me and mine
The Tempest	1	2	197	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
The Tempest	1	2	198	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	With all the honors, on my brother; whereon,
The Tempest	1	2	199	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A treacherous army levied, one midnight
The Tempest	1	2	200	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open
The Tempest	1	2	201	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness
The Tempest	1	2	202	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence
The Tempest	1	2	203	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Me and thy crying self.
The Tempest	1	2	204	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Alack, for pity!
The Tempest	1	2	205	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,
The Tempest	1	2	206	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint
The Tempest	1	2	207	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	That wrings mine eyes to ’t.
The Tempest	1	2	208	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Hear a little further,
The Tempest	1	2	209	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And then I’ll bring thee to the present business
The Tempest	1	2	210	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story
The Tempest	1	2	211	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Were most impertinent.
The Tempest	1	2	212	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Wherefore did they not
The Tempest	1	2	213	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	That hour destroy us?
The Tempest	1	2	214	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Well demanded, wench.
The Tempest	1	2	215	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
The Tempest	1	2	216	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
The Tempest	1	2	217	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A mark so bloody on the business, but
The Tempest	1	2	218	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	With colors fairer painted their foul ends.
The Tempest	1	2	219	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
The Tempest	1	2	220	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared
The Tempest	1	2	221	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,
The Tempest	1	2	222	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
The Tempest	1	2	223	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us
The Tempest	1	2	224	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh
The Tempest	1	2	225	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,
The Tempest	1	2	226	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Did us but loving wrong.
The Tempest	1	2	227	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Alack, what trouble
The Tempest	1	2	228	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	Was I then to you!
The Tempest	1	2	229	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	O, a cherubin
The Tempest	1	2	230	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
The Tempest	1	2	231	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven,
The Tempest	1	2	232	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,
The Tempest	1	2	233	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Under my burden groaned, which raised in me
The Tempest	1	2	234	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	An undergoing stomach to bear up
The Tempest	1	2	235	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Against what should ensue.
The Tempest	1	2	236	speech	verse	Miranda_Tmp	How came we ashore?
The Tempest	1	2	237	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	By providence divine.

The Tempest	1	2	350	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Dost thou forget
The Tempest	1	2	351	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	From what a torment I did free thee?
The Tempest	1	2	352	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	No.
The Tempest	1	2	353	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze

The Tempest	1	2	357	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	When it is baked with frost.
The Tempest	1	2	358	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	I do not, sir.
The Tempest	1	2	359	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot

The Tempest	1	2	361	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?
The Tempest	1	2	362	speech	prose	Ariel_Tmp	No, sir.
The Tempest	1	2	363	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.

The Tempest	1	2	366	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
The Tempest	1	2	367	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Which thou forget’st. This damned witch Sycorax,

The Tempest	1	2	369	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To enter human hearing, from Argier,

The Tempest	1	2	372	speech	prose	Ariel_Tmp	Ay, sir.
The Tempest	1	2	373	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
The Tempest	1	2	374	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave,
The Tempest	1	2	375	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant,
The Tempest	1	2	376	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And for thou wast a spirit too delicate
The Tempest	1	2	377	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To act her earthy and abhorred commands,
The Tempest	1	2	378	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
The Tempest	1	2	379	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	By help of her more potent ministers

The Tempest	1	2	384	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
The Tempest	1	2	385	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island
The Tempest	1	2	386	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	(Save for the son that she did litter here,

The Tempest	1	2	389	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	Yes, Caliban, her son.
The Tempest	1	2	390	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
The Tempest	1	2	391	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st
The Tempest	1	2	392	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans
The Tempest	1	2	393	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
The Tempest	1	2	394	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Of ever-angry bears. It was a torment
The Tempest	1	2	395	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax
The Tempest	1	2	396	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Could not again undo. It was mine art,
The Tempest	1	2	397	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The Tempest	1	2	398	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	The pine and let thee out.
The Tempest	1	2	399	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	I thank thee, master.
The Tempest	1	2	400	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak
The Tempest	1	2	401	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
The Tempest	1	2	402	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Thou hast howled away twelve winters.
The Tempest	1	2	403	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	Pardon, master.
The Tempest	1	2	404	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	I will be correspondent to command
The Tempest	1	2	405	speech	verse	Ariel_Tmp	And do my spriting gently.
The Tempest	1	2	406	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Do so, and after two days
The Tempest	1	2	407	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	I will discharge thee.

The Tempest	2	1	757	speech	prose	Adrian_Tmp	“Widow Dido,” said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
The Tempest	2	1	758	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
The Tempest	2	1	759	speech	prose	Adrian_Tmp	Carthage?
The Tempest	2	1	760	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	I assure you, Carthage.
The Tempest	2	1	761	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	His word is more than the miraculous harp.
The Tempest	2	1	762	speech	prose	Sebastian_Tmp	He hath raised the wall, and houses too.
The Tempest	2	1	763	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	What impossible matter will he make easy next?
The Tempest	2	1	764	speech	prose	Sebastian_Tmp	I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.
The Tempest	2	1	765	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
The Tempest	2	1	766	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	Ay.
The Tempest	2	1	767	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	Why, in good time.
The Tempest	2	1	768	direction	delivery	Gonzalo_Tmp	, to Alonso
The Tempest	2	1	769	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.
The Tempest	2	1	770	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	And the rarest that e’er came there.
The Tempest	2	1	771	speech	prose	Sebastian_Tmp	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
The Tempest	2	1	772	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.
The Tempest	2	1	773	direction	delivery	Gonzalo_Tmp	, to Alonso
The Tempest	2	1	774	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.
The Tempest	2	1	775	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	That “sort” was well fished for.
The Tempest	2	1	776	direction	delivery	Gonzalo_Tmp	, to Alonso
The Tempest	2	1	777	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage.
The Tempest	2	1	778	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	You cram these words into mine ears against
The Tempest	2	1	779	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
The Tempest	2	1	780	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Married my daughter there, for coming thence
The Tempest	2	1	781	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,
The Tempest	2	1	782	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Who is so far from Italy removed
The Tempest	2	1	783	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	I ne’er again shall see her.—O, thou mine heir
The Tempest	2	1	784	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
The Tempest	2	1	785	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Hath made his meal on thee?
The Tempest	2	1	786	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	Sir, he may live.
The Tempest	2	1	787	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	I saw him beat the surges under him
The Tempest	2	1	788	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,
The Tempest	2	1	789	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The Tempest	2	1	790	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head
The Tempest	2	1	791	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared
The Tempest	2	1	792	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
The Tempest	2	1	793	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,
The Tempest	2	1	794	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt
The Tempest	2	1	795	speech	verse	Francisco_Tmp	He came alive to land.
The Tempest	2	1	796	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	No, no, he’s gone.
The Tempest	2	1	797	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
The Tempest	2	1	798	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
The Tempest	2	1	799	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	But rather lose her to an African,
The Tempest	2	1	800	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Where she at least is banished from your eye,
The Tempest	2	1	801	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.
The Tempest	2	1	802	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Prithee, peace.
The Tempest	2	1	803	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise
The Tempest	2	1	804	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	By all of us; and the fair soul herself
The Tempest	2	1	805	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Weighed between loathness and obedience at
The Tempest	2	1	806	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,
The Tempest	2	1	807	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have
The Tempest	2	1	808	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	More widows in them of this business’ making
The Tempest	2	1	809	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Than we bring men to comfort them.
The Tempest	2	1	810	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	The fault’s your own.
The Tempest	2	1	811	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.
The Tempest	2	1	812	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	My lord Sebastian,
The Tempest	2	1	813	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
The Tempest	2	1	814	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	And time to speak it in. You rub the sore
The Tempest	2	1	815	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	When you should bring the plaster.
The Tempest	2	1	816	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Very well.
The Tempest	2	1	817	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And most chirurgeonly.
The Tempest	2	1	818	direction	delivery	Gonzalo_Tmp	, to Alonso
The Tempest	2	1	819	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
The Tempest	2	1	820	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	When you are cloudy.
The Tempest	2	1	821	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Foul weather?
The Tempest	2	1	822	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Very foul.
The Tempest	2	1	823	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Had I plantation of this isle, my lord—
The Tempest	2	1	824	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.
The Tempest	2	1	825	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Or docks, or mallows.
The Tempest	2	1	826	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	And were the king on ’t, what would I do?
The Tempest	2	1	827	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Scape being drunk, for want of wine.
The Tempest	2	1	828	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries
The Tempest	2	1	829	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Execute all things, for no kind of traffic
The Tempest	2	1	830	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
The Tempest	2	1	831	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
The Tempest	2	1	832	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	And use of service, none; contract, succession,
The Tempest	2	1	833	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
The Tempest	2	1	834	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
The Tempest	2	1	835	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	No occupation; all men idle, all,
The Tempest	2	1	836	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	And women too, but innocent and pure;
The Tempest	2	1	837	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	No sovereignty—
The Tempest	2	1	838	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Yet he would be king on ’t.
The Tempest	2	1	839	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.
The Tempest	2	1	840	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	All things in common nature should produce
The Tempest	2	1	841	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,
The Tempest	2	1	842	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine
The Tempest	2	1	843	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Would I not have; but nature should bring forth
The Tempest	2	1	844	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,
The Tempest	2	1	845	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	To feed my innocent people.
The Tempest	2	1	846	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	No marrying ’mong his subjects?
The Tempest	2	1	847	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.
The Tempest	2	1	848	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	I would with such perfection govern, sir,
The Tempest	2	1	849	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	T’ excel the Golden Age.
The Tempest	2	1	850	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	’Save his Majesty!
The Tempest	2	1	851	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Long live Gonzalo!
The Tempest	2	1	852	speech	verse	Gonzalo_Tmp	And do you mark me, sir?
The Tempest	2	1	853	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.
The Tempest	2	1	854	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	I do well believe your Highness, and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
The Tempest	2	1	855	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	’Twas you we laughed at.
The Tempest	2	1	856	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.
The Tempest	2	1	857	speech	prose	Antonio_Tmp	What a blow was there given!
The Tempest	2	1	858	speech	prose	Sebastian_Tmp	An it had not fallen flatlong.
The Tempest	2	1	859	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.

The Tempest	2	1	865	speech	prose	Gonzalo_Tmp	No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep? For I am very heavy.

The Tempest	2	1	868	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes
The Tempest	2	1	869	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find
The Tempest	2	1	870	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	They are inclined to do so.
The Tempest	2	1	871	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Please you, sir,
The Tempest	2	1	872	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Do not omit the heavy offer of it.
The Tempest	2	1	873	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
The Tempest	2	1	874	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	It is a comforter.
The Tempest	2	1	875	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	We two, my lord,
The Tempest	2	1	876	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Will guard your person while you take your rest,
The Tempest	2	1	877	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And watch your safety.
The Tempest	2	1	878	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

The Tempest	2	1	883	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Why
The Tempest	2	1	884	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find
The Tempest	2	1	885	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Not myself disposed to sleep.
The Tempest	2	1	886	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Nor I. My spirits are nimble.
The Tempest	2	1	887	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	They fell together all, as by consent.
The Tempest	2	1	888	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,
The Tempest	2	1	889	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more.
The Tempest	2	1	890	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And yet methinks I see it in thy face
The Tempest	2	1	891	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and
The Tempest	2	1	892	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	My strong imagination sees a crown
The Tempest	2	1	893	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Dropping upon thy head.
The Tempest	2	1	894	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	What, art thou waking?
The Tempest	2	1	895	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Do you not hear me speak?
The Tempest	2	1	896	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	I do, and surely
The Tempest	2	1	897	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st
The Tempest	2	1	898	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
The Tempest	2	1	899	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	This is a strange repose, to be asleep
The Tempest	2	1	900	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	With eyes wide open—standing, speaking, moving—
The Tempest	2	1	901	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	And yet so fast asleep.
The Tempest	2	1	902	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Noble Sebastian,
The Tempest	2	1	903	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Thou let’st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink’st
The Tempest	2	1	904	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Whiles thou art waking.
The Tempest	2	1	905	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Thou dost snore distinctly.
The Tempest	2	1	906	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	There’s meaning in thy snores.
The Tempest	2	1	907	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	I am more serious than my custom. You
The Tempest	2	1	908	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Must be so too, if heed me; which to do

The Tempest	2	1	910	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Well, I am standing water.
The Tempest	2	1	911	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	I’ll teach you how to flow.
The Tempest	2	1	912	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Do so. To ebb

The Tempest	2	1	914	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	O,
The Tempest	2	1	915	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
The Tempest	2	1	916	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it
The Tempest	2	1	917	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed
The Tempest	2	1	918	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Most often do so near the bottom run
The Tempest	2	1	919	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	By their own fear or sloth.

The Tempest	2	1	921	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
The Tempest	2	1	922	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
The Tempest	2	1	923	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Which throes thee much to yield.
The Tempest	2	1	924	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Thus, sir:
The Tempest	2	1	925	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Although this lord of weak remembrance—this,
The Tempest	2	1	926	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Who shall be of as little memory
The Tempest	2	1	927	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	When he is earthed—hath here almost persuaded—

The Tempest	2	1	929	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Professes to persuade—the King his son’s alive,
The Tempest	2	1	930	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned
The Tempest	2	1	931	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	As he that sleeps here swims.
The Tempest	2	1	932	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	I have no hope
The Tempest	2	1	933	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	That he’s undrowned.
The Tempest	2	1	934	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	O, out of that no hope
The Tempest	2	1	935	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	What great hope have you! No hope that way is
The Tempest	2	1	936	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Another way so high a hope that even
The Tempest	2	1	937	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
The Tempest	2	1	938	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
The Tempest	2	1	939	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	That Ferdinand is drowned?
The Tempest	2	1	940	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	He’s gone.
The Tempest	2	1	941	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Then tell me,

The Tempest	2	1	944	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
The Tempest	2	1	945	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples
The Tempest	2	1	946	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Can have no note, unless the sun were post—
The Tempest	2	1	947	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	The man i’ th’ moon’s too slow—till newborn chins
The Tempest	2	1	948	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
The Tempest	2	1	949	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,
The Tempest	2	1	950	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And by that destiny to perform an act
The Tempest	2	1	951	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come
The Tempest	2	1	952	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	In yours and my discharge.
The Tempest	2	1	953	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	What stuff is this? How say you?
The Tempest	2	1	954	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	’Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis,
The Tempest	2	1	955	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions
The Tempest	2	1	956	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	There is some space.
The Tempest	2	1	957	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	A space whose ev’ry cubit
The Tempest	2	1	958	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel
The Tempest	2	1	959	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis
The Tempest	2	1	960	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death
The Tempest	2	1	961	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse
The Tempest	2	1	962	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples

The Tempest	2	1	964	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	As amply and unnecessarily
The Tempest	2	1	965	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	As this Gonzalo. I myself could make
The Tempest	2	1	966	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The Tempest	2	1	967	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	The mind that I do, what a sleep were this
The Tempest	2	1	968	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	For your advancement! Do you understand me?
The Tempest	2	1	969	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Methinks I do.
The Tempest	2	1	970	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And how does your content
The Tempest	2	1	971	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Tender your own good fortune?
The Tempest	2	1	972	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	I remember
The Tempest	2	1	973	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	You did supplant your brother Prospero.
The Tempest	2	1	974	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	True,
The Tempest	2	1	975	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	And look how well my garments sit upon me,
The Tempest	2	1	976	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Much feater than before. My brother’s servants
The Tempest	2	1	977	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
The Tempest	2	1	978	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	But, for your conscience?
The Tempest	2	1	979	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Ay, sir, where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,
The Tempest	2	1	980	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	’Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not

The Tempest	2	1	982	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they

The Tempest	2	1	985	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead—
The Tempest	2	1	986	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
The Tempest	2	1	987	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,

The Tempest	2	1	989	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who

I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.  Alas, the storm is come again. My best way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.

The Tempest	5	1	2151	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	The best news is that we have safely found
The Tempest	5	1	2152	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	Our king and company. The next: our ship,
The Tempest	5	1	2153	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split,

The Tempest	5	1	2160	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	My tricksy spirit!
The Tempest	5	1	2161	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	These are not natural events. They strengthen

The Tempest	5	1	2163	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
The Tempest	5	1	2164	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep
The Tempest	5	1	2165	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	And—how, we know not—all clapped under hatches,
The Tempest	5	1	2166	speech	verse	Boatswain_Tmp	Where, but even now, with strange and several noises

The Tempest	5	1	2179	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,
The Tempest	5	1	2180	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	And there is in this business more than nature
The Tempest	5	1	2181	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Was ever conduct of. Some oracle
The Tempest	5	1	2182	speech	verse	Alonso_Tmp	Must rectify our knowledge.
The Tempest	5	1	2183	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Sir, my liege,
The Tempest	5	1	2184	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Do not infest your mind with beating on

The Tempest	5	1	2202	speech	verse	Sebastian_Tmp	Will money buy ’em?
The Tempest	5	1	2203	speech	verse	Antonio_Tmp	Very like. One of them

The Tempest	5	1	2205	speech	verse	Prospero_Tmp	Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
