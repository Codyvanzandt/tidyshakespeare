The Merchant of Venice	1	1	1	direction	entrance	Salarino_MV	Enter Antonio, Salarino, and Solanio.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	1	direction	entrance	Solanio_MV	Enter Antonio, Salarino, and Solanio.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	2	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	In sooth I know not why I am so sad.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	3	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	It wearies me, you say it wearies you.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	4	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	5	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	6	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I am to learn.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	7	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	8	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	That I have much ado to know myself.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	9	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Your mind is tossing on the ocean,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	10	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	There where your argosies with portly sail
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	11	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	(Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	12	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea)
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	13	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Do overpeer the petty traffickers
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	14	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	15	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	As they fly by them with their woven wings.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	16	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	17	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	The better part of my affections would
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	18	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	19	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	20	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	21	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	And every object that might make me fear
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	22	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	23	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Would make me sad.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	24	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	My wind cooling my broth
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	25	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Would blow me to an ague when I thought
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	26	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	27	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	I should not see the sandy hourglass run
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	28	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	But I should think of shallows and of flats,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	29	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	30	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	31	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	32	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And see the holy edifice of stone
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	33	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	34	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	35	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	36	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	37	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And, in a word, but even now worth this
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	38	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	39	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	40	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	41	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	But tell not me: I know Antonio
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	42	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	43	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	44	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	45	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	46	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Upon the fortune of this present year:
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	47	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	48	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Why then you are in love.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	49	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Fie, fie!
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	50	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	51	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	52	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	53	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	54	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	55	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	56	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	57	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	And other of such vinegar aspect
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	58	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	59	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	60	direction	entrance	Bassanio_MV	Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	60	direction	entrance	Lorenzo_MV	Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	60	direction	entrance	Gratiano_MV	Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	61	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	62	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare you well.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	63	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	We leave you now with better company.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	64	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	I would have stayed till I had made you merry,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	65	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	If worthier friends had not prevented me.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	66	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Your worth is very dear in my regard.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	67	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I take it your own business calls on you,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	68	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	69	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Good morrow, my good lords.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	70	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	71	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	72	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	73	direction	exit	Salarino_MV	Salarino and Solanio exit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	73	direction	exit	Solanio_MV	Salarino and Solanio exit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	74	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	75	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	We two will leave you. But at dinner time
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	76	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	77	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I will not fail you.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	78	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	You look not well, Signior Antonio.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	79	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	You have too much respect upon the world.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	80	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	They lose it that do buy it with much care.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	81	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Believe me, you are marvelously changed.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	82	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	83	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	A stage where every man must play a part,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	84	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And mine a sad one.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	85	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Let me play the fool.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	86	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	87	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And let my liver rather heat with wine
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	88	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	89	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Why should a man whose blood is warm within
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	90	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	91	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	92	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	93	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	94	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	There are a sort of men whose visages
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	95	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Do cream and mantle like a standing pond
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	96	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And do a willful stillness entertain
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	97	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	With purpose to be dressed in an opinion
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	98	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	99	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	As who should say “I am Sir Oracle,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	100	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	101	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	O my Antonio, I do know of these
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	102	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	That therefore only are reputed wise
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	103	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	For saying nothing, when, I am very sure,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	104	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	If they should speak, would almost damn those ears
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	105	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	106	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I’ll tell thee more of this another time.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	107	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	But fish not with this melancholy bait
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	108	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.—
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	109	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Come, good Lorenzo.—Fare you well a while.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	110	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	111	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Well, we will leave you then till dinner time.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	112	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	113	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	For Gratiano never lets me speak.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	114	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Well, keep me company but two years more,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	115	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	116	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	117	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	118	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	119	direction	exit	Gratiano_MV	Gratiano and Lorenzo exit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	119	direction	exit	Lorenzo_MV	Gratiano and Lorenzo exit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	120	speech	prose	Antonio_MV	Is that anything now?
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	121	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them, they are not worth the search.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	122	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Well, tell me now what lady is the same
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	123	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	124	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	That you today promised to tell me of?
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	125	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	126	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	How much I have disabled mine estate
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	127	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	By something showing a more swelling port
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	128	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Than my faint means would grant continuance.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	129	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	130	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	From such a noble rate. But my chief care
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	131	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Is to come fairly off from the great debts
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	132	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	133	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	134	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I owe the most in money and in love,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	135	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And from your love I have a warranty
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	136	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	To unburden all my plots and purposes
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	137	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	138	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	139	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	140	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Within the eye of honor, be assured
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	141	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	My purse, my person, my extremest means
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	142	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Lie all unlocked to your occasions.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	143	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	144	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	145	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	The selfsame way with more advisèd watch
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	146	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	To find the other forth; and by adventuring both
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	147	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	148	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Because what follows is pure innocence.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	149	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I owe you much, and, like a willful youth,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	150	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	That which I owe is lost. But if you please
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	151	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	To shoot another arrow that self way
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	152	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	153	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	As I will watch the aim, or to find both
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	154	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Or bring your latter hazard back again,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	155	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	156	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	You know me well, and herein spend but time
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	157	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	To wind about my love with circumstance;
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	158	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	159	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	In making question of my uttermost
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	160	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Than if you had made waste of all I have.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	161	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Then do but say to me what I should do
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	162	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	That in your knowledge may by me be done,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	163	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And I am prest unto it. Therefore speak.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	164	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	In Belmont is a lady richly left,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	165	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	166	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	167	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I did receive fair speechless messages.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	168	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	169	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	170	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	171	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	For the four winds blow in from every coast
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	172	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Renownèd suitors, and her sunny locks
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	173	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	174	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	175	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And many Jasons come in quest of her.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	176	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	O my Antonio, had I but the means
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	177	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	To hold a rival place with one of them,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	178	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I have a mind presages me such thrift
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	179	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	That I should questionless be fortunate!
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	180	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	181	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Neither have I money nor commodity
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	182	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	To raise a present sum. Therefore go forth:
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	183	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Try what my credit can in Venice do;
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	184	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	That shall be racked even to the uttermost
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	185	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	186	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Go presently inquire, and so will I,
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	187	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Where money is, and I no question make
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	188	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	To have it of my trust, or for my sake.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	189	direction	exit	Antonio_MV	They exit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	1	189	direction	exit	Bassanio_MV	They exit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	190	direction	entrance	Portia_MV	Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	190	direction	entrance	Nerissa_MV	Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	191	speech	prose	Portia_MV	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	192	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	193	speech	prose	Portia_MV	Good sentences, and well pronounced.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	194	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	They would be better if well followed.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	195	speech	prose	Portia_MV	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O, me, the word “choose”! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike. So is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	196	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	197	speech	prose	Portia_MV	I pray thee, overname them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	198	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	199	speech	prose	Portia_MV	Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	200	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	Then is there the County Palatine.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	201	speech	prose	Portia_MV	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say “An you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	202	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	203	speech	prose	Portia_MV	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!—why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands! If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	204	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	205	speech	prose	Portia_MV	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian; and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	206	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	207	speech	prose	Portia_MV	That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	208	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	209	speech	prose	Portia_MV	Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk. When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	210	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will if you should refuse to accept him.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	211	speech	prose	Portia_MV	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	212	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	213	speech	prose	Portia_MV	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure!
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	214	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	215	speech	prose	Portia_MV	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio—as I think so was he called.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	216	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	217	speech	prose	Portia_MV	I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.

The Merchant of Venice	1	2	221	speech	prose	Portia_MV	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
The Merchant of Venice	1	2	222	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.—

The Merchant of Venice	1	3	228	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	Ay, sir, for three months.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	229	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	For three months, well.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	230	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

The Merchant of Venice	1	3	233	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	234	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	Your answer to that?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	235	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	Antonio is a good man.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	236	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	237	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land rats and water rats, water thieves and land thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his bond.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	238	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	Be assured you may.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	239	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	240	speech	prose	Bassanio_MV	If it please you to dine with us.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	241	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	Yes, to smell pork! To eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into! I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.—What news on the Rialto?—Who is he comes here?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	242	direction	entrance	Antonio_MV	Enter Antonio.

The Merchant of Venice	1	3	244	direction	delivery	Shylock_MV	, aside
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	245	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	How like a fawning publican he looks!
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	246	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I hate him for he is a Christian,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	247	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	But more for that in low simplicity
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	248	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	He lends out money gratis and brings down
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	249	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	250	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	If I can catch him once upon the hip,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	251	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	252	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	253	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Even there where merchants most do congregate,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	254	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	255	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Which he calls “interest.” Cursèd be my tribe
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	256	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	If I forgive him!
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	257	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Shylock, do you hear?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	258	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I am debating of my present store,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	259	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And, by the near guess of my memory,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	260	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I cannot instantly raise up the gross
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	261	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	262	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	263	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Will furnish me. But soft, how many months
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	264	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Do you desire? Rest you fair, good signior!
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	265	direction	delivery	Shylock_MV	To Antonio.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	266	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Your Worship was the last man in our mouths.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	267	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	268	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	By taking nor by giving of excess,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	269	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	270	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I’ll break a custom. Is he yet possessed

The Merchant of Venice	1	3	272	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	How much you would?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	273	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	274	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And for three months.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	275	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I had forgot—three months.You told me so.—
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	276	direction	delivery	Shylock_MV	To Bassanio.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	277	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Well then, your bond. And let me see—but hear you:
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	278	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	279	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Upon advantage.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	280	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I do never use it.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	281	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	When Jacob grazed his Uncle Laban’s sheep—
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	282	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	This Jacob from our holy Abram was
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	283	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	284	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	The third possessor; ay, he was the third—
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	285	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	And what of him? Did he take interest?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	286	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	287	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Directly “interest.” Mark what Jacob did.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	288	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	When Laban and himself were compromised
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	289	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	290	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	291	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	In end of autumn turnèd to the rams,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	292	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And when the work of generation was
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	293	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	294	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	The skillful shepherd pilled me certain wands,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	295	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And in the doing of the deed of kind
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	296	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	297	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Who then conceiving did in eaning time
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	298	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Fall parti-colored lambs, and those were Jacob’s.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	299	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	300	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	301	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	302	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	303	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	304	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Was this inserted to make interest good?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	305	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	306	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.

The Merchant of Venice	1	3	309	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Mark you this, Bassanio,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	310	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose!
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	311	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	An evil soul producing holy witness
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	312	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	313	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	314	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	315	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Three thousand ducats. ’Tis a good round sum.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	316	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Three months from twelve, then let me see, the rate—
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	317	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	318	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	319	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	In the Rialto you have rated me
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	320	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	About my moneys and my usances.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	321	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Still have I borne it with a patient shrug
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	322	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe).
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	323	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	324	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	325	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And all for use of that which is mine own.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	326	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Well then, it now appears you need my help.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	327	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Go to, then. You come to me and you say
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	328	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	“Shylock, we would have moneys”—you say so,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	329	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	330	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	331	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Over your threshold. Moneys is your suit.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	332	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	What should I say to you? Should I not say
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	333	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	“Hath a dog money? Is it possible
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	334	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	335	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Shall I bend low, and in a bondman’s key,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	336	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	337	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Say this: “Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	338	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	You spurned me such a day; another time
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	339	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	You called me ‘dog’; and for these courtesies
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	340	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	341	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I am as like to call thee so again,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	342	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	To spet on thee again, to spurn thee, too.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	343	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	344	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	345	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	A breed for barren metal of his friend?
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	346	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	But lend it rather to thine enemy,
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	347	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	348	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Exact the penalty.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	349	speech	verse	Shylock_MV	Why, look you how you storm!

The Merchant of Venice	1	3	367	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	You shall not seal to such a bond for me!
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	368	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
The Merchant of Venice	1	3	369	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it!

The Merchant of Venice	2	2	450	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo, Lancelet Gobbo, good Lancelet,” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Lancelet Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says “No. Take heed, honest Lancelet, take heed, honest Gobbo,” or, as aforesaid, “honest Lancelet Gobbo, do not run; scorn running with thy heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend. “Away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run!” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend Lancelet, being an honest man’s son”—or rather, an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to—he had a kind of taste—well, my conscience says “Lancelet, budge not.” “Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend. My heels are at your commandment. I will run.

The Merchant of Venice	2	2	473	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me. It is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing. Truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid long—a man’s son may, but in the end, truth will out.

The Merchant of Venice	2	2	478	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Lancelet, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.
The Merchant of Venice	2	2	479	speech	prose	OldGobbo_MV	Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if thou be Lancelet, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshiped might He be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

My master’s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come! Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes the man!

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	799	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	And yet to be afeard of my deserving

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	818	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	819	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Is ’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	821	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	822	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Or shall I think in silver she’s immured,

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	824	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	O, sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	825	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	826	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	A coin that bears the figure of an angel
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	827	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Stamped in gold, but that’s insculped upon;

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	836	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	A carrion death within whose empty eye
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	837	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	There is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing:

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	839	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Often have you heard that told.

The Merchant of Venice	2	7	841	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	But my outside to behold.
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	842	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Gilded tombs do worms infold.
The Merchant of Venice	2	7	843	speech	verse	Morocco_MV	Had you been as wise as bold,

The Merchant of Venice	2	8	857	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	With him is Gratiano gone along;
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	858	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	859	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	860	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	861	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	He came too late; the ship was under sail.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	862	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	But there the Duke was given to understand
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	863	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	That in a gondola were seen together
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	864	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	865	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Besides, Antonio certified the Duke
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	866	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	867	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	I never heard a passion so confused,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	868	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	So strange, outrageous, and so variable

The Merchant of Venice	2	8	877	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.”
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	878	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,

The Merchant of Venice	2	8	880	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	881	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Or he shall pay for this.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	882	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Marry, well remembered.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	883	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	884	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Who told me, in the Narrow Seas that part
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	885	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	The French and English, there miscarrièd
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	886	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	A vessel of our country richly fraught.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	887	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	I thought upon Antonio when he told me,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	888	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And wished in silence that it were not his.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	889	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear—
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	890	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	891	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	A kinder gentleman treads not the Earth.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	892	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	893	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Bassanio told him he would make some speed
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	894	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Of his return. He answered “Do not so.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	895	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	896	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	But stay the very riping of the time;
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	897	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	898	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Let it not enter in your mind of love.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	899	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	900	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	To courtship and such fair ostents of love
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	901	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	As shall conveniently become you there.”
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	902	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And even there, his eye being big with tears,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	903	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	904	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	And with affection wondrous sensible
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	905	speech	verse	Salarino_MV	He wrung Bassanio’s hand—and so they parted.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	906	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	I think he only loves the world for him.
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	907	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	I pray thee, let us go and find him out
The Merchant of Venice	2	8	908	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	And quicken his embracèd heaviness

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	921	speech	verse	Portia_MV	You must be gone from hence immediately.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	922	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	923	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	First, never to unfold to anyone
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	924	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	926	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	To woo a maid in way of marriage;
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	927	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Lastly, if I do fail in fortune of my choice,
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	928	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Immediately to leave you, and be gone.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	929	speech	verse	Portia_MV	To these injunctions everyone doth swear
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	930	speech	verse	Portia_MV	That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	931	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	And so have I addressed me. Fortune now
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	932	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	933	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	934	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	935	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see:
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	936	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	937	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	What many men desire—that “many” may be meant
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	938	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	By the fool multitude that choose by show,
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	939	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	940	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	942	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Even in the force and road of casualty.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	943	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	I will not choose what many men desire,
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	944	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Because I will not jump with common spirits
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	945	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	946	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Why, then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	947	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	948	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	949	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	And well said, too; for who shall go about
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	950	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	To cozen fortune and be honorable
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	951	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	953	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	O, that estates, degrees, and offices

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	955	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	956	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	How many then should cover that stand bare?

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	958	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	How much low peasantry would then be gleaned

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	961	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	To be new varnished? Well, but to my choice.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	962	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	963	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,

The Merchant of Venice	2	9	970	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	How much unlike art thou to Portia!
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	971	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	How much unlike my hopes and my deservings.
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	972	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	“Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”?
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	973	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	974	speech	verse	Arragon_MV	Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	975	speech	verse	Portia_MV	To offend and judge are distinct offices
The Merchant of Venice	2	9	976	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And of opposèd natures.

A bankrout, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart! Let him look to his bond.

The Merchant of Venice	3	1	1042	speech	prose	Salarino_MV	Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What’s that good for?
The Merchant of Venice	3	1	1043	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies— and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.

The Merchant of Venice	3	1	1052	speech	prose	Shylock_MV	Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt!

Why, thou loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a’ my shoulders, no sighs but a’ my breathing, no tears but a’ my shedding.

The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1248	direction	business	Bassanio_MV	Handing him a ring.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1249	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Which, when you part from, lose, or give away,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1250	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Let it presage the ruin of your love,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1251	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1252	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Madam, you have bereft me of all words.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1253	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1254	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And there is such confusion in my powers
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1255	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	As after some oration fairly spoke
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1256	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	By a belovèd prince there doth appear
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1257	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Among the buzzing pleasèd multitude,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1258	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Where every something being blent together
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1259	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1260	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Expressed and not expressed. But when this ring
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1261	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1262	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1263	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	My lord and lady, it is now our time,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1264	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1265	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	To cry “Good joy, good joy, my lord and lady!”
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1266	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1267	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I wish you all the joy that you can wish,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1268	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	For I am sure you can wish none from me.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1269	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And when your honors mean to solemnize
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1270	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1271	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Even at that time I may be married too.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1272	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1273	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I thank your Lordship, you have got me one.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1274	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1275	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1276	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	You loved, I loved; for intermission
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1277	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1278	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1279	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And so did mine, too, as the matter falls.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1280	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	For wooing here until I sweat again,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1281	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And swearing till my very roof was dry
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1282	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	With oaths of love, at last (if promise last)
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1283	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I got a promise of this fair one here
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1284	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	To have her love, provided that your fortune
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1285	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Achieved her mistress.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1286	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Is this true, Nerissa?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1287	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1288	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1289	speech	prose	Gratiano_MV	Yes, faith, my lord.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1290	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1291	speech	prose	Gratiano_MV	We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1292	speech	prose	Nerissa_MV	What, and stake down?

The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1297	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither—
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1298	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	If that the youth of my new int’rest here

The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1300	direction	delivery	Bassanio_MV	To Portia.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1301	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I bid my very friends and countrymen,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1302	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Sweet Portia, welcome.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1303	speech	verse	Portia_MV	So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1304	direction	delivery	Lorenzo_MV	, to Bassanio
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1305	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	I thank your Honor. For my part, my lord,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1306	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	My purpose was not to have seen you here,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1307	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	But meeting with Salerio by the way,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1308	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	He did entreat me past all saying nay
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1309	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	To come with him along.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1310	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	I did, my lord,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1311	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	And I have reason for it.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1312	direction	business	Salerio_MV	Handing him a paper.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1312	direction	business	Bassanio_MV	Handing him a paper.

The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1314	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Commends him to you.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1315	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Ere I ope his letter,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1316	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1317	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1318	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1319	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Will show you his estate.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1320	direction	business	Bassanio_MV	Bassanio opens the letter.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1321	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.—
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1322	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1323	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1324	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I know he will be glad of our success.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1325	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	We are the Jasons, we have won the Fleece.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1326	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1327	speech	verse	Portia_MV	There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1328	speech	verse	Portia_MV	That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1329	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1330	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Could turn so much the constitution
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1331	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?—
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1332	speech	verse	Portia_MV	With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1333	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And I must freely have the half of anything
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1334	speech	verse	Portia_MV	That this same paper brings you.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1335	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	O sweet Portia,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1336	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1337	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1338	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	When I did first impart my love to you,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1339	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I freely told you all the wealth I had
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1340	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Ran in my veins: I was a gentleman.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1341	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1342	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1343	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	How much I was a braggart. When I told you
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1344	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	My state was nothing, I should then have told you
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1345	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	That I was worse than nothing; for indeed
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1346	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1347	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Engaged my friend to his mere enemy
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1348	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1349	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	The paper as the body of my friend,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1350	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And every word in it a gaping wound
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1351	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Issuing life blood.—But is it true, Salerio?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1352	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Hath all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1353	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1354	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1355	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1356	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Of merchant-marring rocks?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1357	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Not one, my lord.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1358	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Besides, it should appear that if he had
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1359	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	The present money to discharge the Jew,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1360	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	He would not take it. Never did I know
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1361	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	A creature that did bear the shape of man
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1362	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	So keen and greedy to confound a man.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1363	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	He plies the Duke at morning and at night,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1364	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	And doth impeach the freedom of the state
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1365	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1366	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	The Duke himself, and the magnificoes
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1367	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1368	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	But none can drive him from the envious plea
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1369	speech	verse	Salerio_MV	Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1370	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	When I was with him, I have heard him swear
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1371	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1372	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1373	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	Than twenty times the value of the sum
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1374	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	That he did owe him. And I know, my lord,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1375	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	If law, authority, and power deny not,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1376	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	It will go hard with poor Antonio.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1377	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1378	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1379	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	The best conditioned and unwearied spirit
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1380	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1381	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	The ancient Roman honor more appears
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1382	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Than any that draws breath in Italy.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1383	speech	verse	Portia_MV	What sum owes he the Jew?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1384	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	For me, three thousand ducats.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1385	speech	verse	Portia_MV	What, no more?
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1386	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Pay him six thousand and deface the bond.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1387	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Double six thousand and then treble that,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1388	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Before a friend of this description
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1389	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1390	speech	verse	Portia_MV	First go with me to church and call me wife,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1391	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And then away to Venice to your friend!
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1392	speech	verse	Portia_MV	For never shall you lie by Portia’s side
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1393	speech	verse	Portia_MV	With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1394	speech	verse	Portia_MV	To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1395	speech	verse	Portia_MV	When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1396	speech	verse	Portia_MV	My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1397	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Will live as maids and widows. Come, away,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1398	speech	verse	Portia_MV	For you shall hence upon your wedding day.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1399	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1400	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1401	speech	verse	Portia_MV	But let me hear the letter of your friend.
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1402	direction	delivery	Bassanio_MV	reads
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1403	speech	verse	Portia_MV	O love, dispatch all business and begone!
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1404	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Since I have your good leave to go away,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1405	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I will make haste. But till I come again,
The Merchant of Venice	3	2	1406	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,

The Merchant of Venice	3	3	1435	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Many that have at times made moan to me.

The Merchant of Venice	3	3	1437	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	I am sure the Duke
The Merchant of Venice	3	3	1438	speech	verse	Solanio_MV	Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
The Merchant of Venice	3	3	1439	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	The Duke cannot deny the course of law,

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1459	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	I know you would be prouder of the work
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1460	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Than customary bounty can enforce you.
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1461	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I never did repent for doing good,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1462	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Nor shall not now; for in companions

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1464	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1465	speech	verse	Portia_MV	There must be needs a like proportion
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1466	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1467	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Which makes me think that this Antonio,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1468	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Being the bosom lover of my lord,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1469	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1470	speech	verse	Portia_MV	How little is the cost I have bestowed
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1471	speech	verse	Portia_MV	In purchasing the semblance of my soul
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1472	speech	verse	Portia_MV	From out the state of hellish cruelty!
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1473	speech	verse	Portia_MV	This comes too near the praising of myself;
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1474	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Therefore no more of it. Hear other things:
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1475	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1476	speech	verse	Portia_MV	The husbandry and manage of my house
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1477	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Until my lord’s return. For mine own part,

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1479	speech	verse	Portia_MV	To live in prayer and contemplation,

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1517	speech	verse	Portia_MV	That they shall think we are accomplishèd

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1520	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1521	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1522	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And speak between the change of man and boy
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1523	speech	verse	Portia_MV	With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1524	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1525	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1526	speech	verse	Portia_MV	How honorable ladies sought my love,

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1531	speech	verse	Portia_MV	That men shall swear I have discontinued school
The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1532	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind

The Merchant of Venice	3	4	1540	speech	verse	Portia_MV	At the park gate; and therefore haste away,

The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1544	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children. Therefore I promise you I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be o’ good cheer, for truly I think you are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1545	speech	prose	Jessica_MV	And what hope is that, I pray thee?
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1546	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1547	speech	prose	Jessica_MV	That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me!
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1548	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Truly, then, I fear you are damned both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1549	speech	prose	Jessica_MV	I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1550	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Truly the more to blame he! We were Christians enow before, e’en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs. If we grow all to be pork eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.

The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1554	speech	prose	Jessica_MV	Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Lancelet and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1555	speech	prose	Lorenzo_MV	I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Lancelet.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1556	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1557	speech	prose	Lorenzo_MV	How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah, bid them prepare for dinner.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1558	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	That is done, sir. They have all stomachs.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1559	speech	prose	Lorenzo_MV	Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1560	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1561	speech	prose	Lorenzo_MV	Will you cover, then, sir?
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1562	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	Not so, sir, neither! I know my duty.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1563	speech	prose	Lorenzo_MV	Yet more quarreling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1564	speech	prose	LanceletGobbo_MV	For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humors and conceits shall govern.

The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1567	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	The fool hath planted in his memory
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1568	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	An army of good words, and I do know
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1569	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	A many fools that stand in better place,
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1570	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Garnished like him, that for a tricksy word
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1571	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica?
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1572	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	And now, good sweet, say thy opinion
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1573	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1574	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	Past all expressing. It is very meet
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1575	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1576	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	For having such a blessing in his lady
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1577	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	He finds the joys of heaven here on Earth,
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1578	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	And if on Earth he do not merit it,
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1579	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	In reason he should never come to heaven.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1580	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1581	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	And on the wager lay two earthly women,
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1582	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	And Portia one, there must be something else

The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1585	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Even such a husband
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1586	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1587	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that!
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1588	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	I will anon. First let us go to dinner.
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1589	speech	verse	Jessica_MV	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach!
The Merchant of Venice	3	5	1590	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.

The Merchant of Venice	4	1	1795	speech	verse	Portia_MV	But mercy is above this sceptered sway.
The Merchant of Venice	4	1	1796	speech	verse	Portia_MV	It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings;
The Merchant of Venice	4	1	1797	speech	verse	Portia_MV	It is an attribute to God Himself;

The Merchant of Venice	4	1	1800	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Though justice be thy plea, consider this:
The Merchant of Venice	4	1	1801	speech	verse	Portia_MV	That in the course of justice none of us
The Merchant of Venice	4	1	1802	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,

The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2324	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,

The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2332	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2333	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	A prating boy that begged it as a fee.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2334	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	I could not for my heart deny it him.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2335	speech	verse	Portia_MV	You were to blame, I must be plain with you,

The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2351	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Deserved it, too. And then the boy, his clerk,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2352	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	That took some pains in writing, he begged mine,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2353	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	And neither man nor master would take aught
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2354	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	But the two rings.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2355	speech	verse	Portia_MV	What ring gave you, my lord?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2356	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2357	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	If I could add a lie unto a fault,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2358	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I would deny it, but you see my finger
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2359	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2360	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Even so void is your false heart of truth.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2361	speech	verse	Portia_MV	By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2362	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Until I see the ring!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2363	direction	delivery	Nerissa_MV	, to Gratiano
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2364	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Nor I in yours
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2365	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Till I again see mine!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2366	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Sweet Portia,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2367	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2368	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2369	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2370	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And how unwillingly I left the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2371	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	When naught would be accepted but the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2372	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2373	speech	verse	Portia_MV	If you had known the virtue of the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2374	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2375	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Or your own honor to contain the ring,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2376	speech	verse	Portia_MV	You would not then have parted with the ring.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2377	speech	verse	Portia_MV	What man is there so much unreasonable,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2378	speech	verse	Portia_MV	If you had pleased to have defended it
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2379	speech	verse	Portia_MV	With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2380	speech	verse	Portia_MV	To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2381	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2382	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2383	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2384	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2385	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2386	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And begged the ring, the which I did deny him
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2387	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And suffered him to go displeased away,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2388	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Even he that had held up the very life
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2389	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2390	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I was enforced to send it after him.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2391	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I was beset with shame and courtesy.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2392	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	My honor would not let ingratitude
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2393	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2394	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	For by these blessèd candles of the night,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2395	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Had you been there, I think you would have begged
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2396	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2397	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Let not that doctor e’er come near my house!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2398	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2399	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And that which you did swear to keep for me,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2400	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I will become as liberal as you:
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2401	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I’ll not deny him anything I have,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2402	speech	verse	Portia_MV	No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2403	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2404	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2405	speech	verse	Portia_MV	If you do not, if I be left alone,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2406	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2407	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2408	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	And I his clerk. Therefore be well advised
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2409	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	How you do leave me to mine own protection.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2410	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Well, do you so. Let not me take him, then,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2411	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2412	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2413	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2414	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2415	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	And in the hearing of these many friends
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2416	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2417	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Wherein I see myself—
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2418	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Mark you but that!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2419	speech	verse	Portia_MV	In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2420	speech	verse	Portia_MV	In each eye one. Swear by your double self,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2421	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And there’s an oath of credit.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2422	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Nay, but hear me.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2423	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2424	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	I never more will break an oath with thee.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2425	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I once did lend my body for his wealth,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2426	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Which but for him that had your husband’s ring
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2427	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2428	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2429	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Will never more break faith advisedly.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2430	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2431	direction	business	Portia_MV	Giving Antonio a ring.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2431	direction	business	Antonio_MV	Giving Antonio a ring.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2432	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And bid him keep it better than the other.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2433	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2434	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2435	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2436	speech	verse	Portia_MV	For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2437	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2438	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	For that same scrubbèd boy, the doctor’s clerk,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2439	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2440	direction	business	Nerissa_MV	She shows a ring.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2441	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Why, this is like the mending of highways
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2442	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	In summer, where the ways are fair enough!
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2443	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2444	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Speak not so grossly.—You are all amazed.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2445	direction	business	Portia_MV	She hands a paper to Bassanio.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2445	direction	business	Bassanio_MV	She hands a paper to Bassanio.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2446	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2447	speech	verse	Portia_MV	It comes from Padua from Bellario.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2448	speech	verse	Portia_MV	There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2449	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2450	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2451	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And even but now returned. I have not yet
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2452	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Entered my house.—Antonio, you are welcome,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2453	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And I have better news in store for you
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2454	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon.

The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2458	speech	verse	Portia_MV	You shall not know by what strange accident
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2459	speech	verse	Portia_MV	I chancèd on this letter.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2460	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	I am dumb.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2461	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2462	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2463	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2464	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Unless he live until he be a man.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2465	direction	delivery	Bassanio_MV	, to Portia
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2466	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2467	speech	verse	Bassanio_MV	When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2468	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2469	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	For here I read for certain that my ships
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2470	speech	verse	Antonio_MV	Are safely come to road.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2471	speech	verse	Portia_MV	How now, Lorenzo?
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2472	speech	verse	Portia_MV	My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2473	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.

The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2475	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	There do I give to you and Jessica,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2476	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2477	speech	verse	Nerissa_MV	After his death, of all he dies possessed of.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2478	speech	verse	Lorenzo_MV	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way

The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2480	speech	verse	Portia_MV	It is almost morning,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2481	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2482	speech	verse	Portia_MV	Of these events at full. Let us go in,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2483	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And charge us there upon inter’gatories,
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2484	speech	verse	Portia_MV	And we will answer all things faithfully.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2485	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Let it be so. The first inter’gatory
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2486	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2487	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Whether till the next night she had rather stay
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2488	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2489	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	But were the day come, I should wish it dark
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2490	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.
The Merchant of Venice	5	1	2491	speech	verse	Gratiano_MV	Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing
