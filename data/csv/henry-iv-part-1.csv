Henry IV, Part I	1	1	2	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	3	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	4	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	5	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To be commenced in strands afar remote.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	6	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	7	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	8	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	No more shall trenching war channel her fields,

Henry IV, Part I	1	1	10	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of hostile paces. Those opposèd eyes,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	11	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	12	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	13	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Did lately meet in the intestine shock
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	14	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And furious close of civil butchery,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	15	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,

Henry IV, Part I	1	1	17	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	18	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The edge of war, like an ill-sheathèd knife,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	19	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	20	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As far as to the sepulcher of Christ—
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	21	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Whose soldier now, under whose blessèd cross
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	22	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	We are impressèd and engaged to fight—
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	23	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	24	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Whose arms were molded in their mothers’ womb
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	25	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	26	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Over whose acres walked those blessèd feet
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	27	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	28	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For our advantage on the bitter cross.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	29	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	30	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	31	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Therefor we meet not now. Then let me hear
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	32	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	33	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	What yesternight our council did decree
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	34	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	In forwarding this dear expedience.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	35	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	My liege, this haste was hot in question,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	36	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And many limits of the charge set down
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	37	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	But yesternight, when all athwart there came
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	38	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	39	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	40	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	41	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	42	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	43	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	A thousand of his people butcherèd,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	44	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	45	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Such beastly shameless transformation
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	46	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	By those Welshwomen done, as may not be
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	47	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Without much shame retold or spoken of.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	48	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	49	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	50	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	This matched with other did, my gracious lord.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	51	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	For more uneven and unwelcome news
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	52	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Came from the north, and thus it did import:
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	53	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	On Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	54	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	55	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That ever valiant and approvèd Scot,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	56	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	At Holmedon met, where they did spend
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	57	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	A sad and bloody hour—
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	58	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	As by discharge of their artillery
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	59	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And shape of likelihood the news was told,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	60	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	For he that brought them, in the very heat
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	61	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And pride of their contention did take horse,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	62	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Uncertain of the issue any way.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	63	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	64	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	65	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Stained with the variation of each soil
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	66	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	67	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	68	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	69	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	70	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	71	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	On Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners Hotspur took
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	72	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Mordake, Earl of Fife and eldest son
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	73	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Atholl,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	74	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	75	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And is not this an honorable spoil?
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	76	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	77	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	78	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	79	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	80	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Should be the father to so blest a son,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	81	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	A son who is the theme of Honor’s tongue,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	82	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	83	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride;
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	84	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	85	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	See riot and dishonor stain the brow
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	86	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	87	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	88	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	89	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And called mine “Percy,” his “Plantagenet”!
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	90	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	91	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	92	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of this young Percy’s pride? The prisoners
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	93	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which he in this adventure hath surprised
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	94	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To his own use he keeps, and sends me word
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	95	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I shall have none but Mordake, Earl of Fife.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	96	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	This is his uncle’s teaching. This is Worcester,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	97	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Malevolent to you in all aspects,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	98	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	99	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	The crest of youth against your dignity.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	100	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But I have sent for him to answer this.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	101	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	102	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	103	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	104	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Will hold at Windsor. So inform the lords.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	105	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But come yourself with speed to us again,
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	106	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For more is to be said and to be done
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	107	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Than out of anger can be utterèd.
Henry IV, Part I	1	1	108	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	I will, my liege.

Henry IV, Part I	1	2	110	direction	entrance	Falstaff_1H4	Enter Prince of Wales, and Sir John Falstaff.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	111	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	112	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colored taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	113	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that wand’ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as God save thy Grace—Majesty, I should say, for grace thou wilt have none—
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	114	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What, none?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	115	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	116	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	117	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Marry then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty. Let us be Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	118	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with swearing “Lay by” and spent with crying “Bring in”; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	119	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	By the Lord, thou sayst true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	120	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	121	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	122	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	123	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	124	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	125	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	No, I’ll give thee thy due. Thou hast paid all there.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	126	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have used my credit.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	127	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent—But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	128	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No, thou shalt.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	129	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	130	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Thou judgest false already. I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	131	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	132	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	For obtaining of suits?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	133	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	134	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	135	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	136	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moorditch?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	137	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Thou hast the most unsavory similes, and art indeed the most comparative, rascaliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talked wisely, and in the street, too.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	138	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	139	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it. Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain. I’ll be damned for never a king’s son in Christendom.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	140	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	141	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Zounds, where thou wilt, lad. I’ll make one. An I do not, call me villain and baffle me.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	142	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	143	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal. ’Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	144	direction	entrance	Poins_1H4	Enter Poins.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	145	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Poins!—Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried “Stand!” to a true man.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	146	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Good morrow, Ned.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	147	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse? What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	148	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Sir John stands to his word. The devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give the devil his due.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	149	direction	delivery	Poins_1H4	, to Falstaff
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	150	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	151	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	152	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning, by four o’clock early at Gad’s Hill, there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I have vizards for you all. You have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns. If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	153	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Hear you, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	154	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	You will, chops?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	155	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Hal, wilt thou make one?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	156	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	157	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	158	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	159	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why, that’s well said.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	160	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	161	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then when thou art king.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	162	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I care not.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	163	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Sir John, I prithee leave the Prince and me alone. I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	164	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be believed, that the true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell. You shall find me in Eastcheap.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	165	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Farewell, thou latter spring. Farewell, Allhallown summer.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	166	direction	exit	Falstaff_1H4	Falstaff exits.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	167	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid. Yourself and I will not be there. And when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	168	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	How shall we part with them in setting forth?
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	169	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	170	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment to be ourselves.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	171	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Tut, our horses they shall not see; I’ll tie them in the wood. Our vizards we will change after we leave them. And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	172	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	173	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lives the jest.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	174	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap. There I’ll sup. Farewell.

Henry IV, Part I	1	2	177	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I know you all, and will awhile uphold
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	178	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	The unyoked humor of your idleness.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	179	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	180	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	181	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	To smother up his beauty from the world,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	182	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That, when he please again to be himself,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	183	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Being wanted, he may be more wondered at
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	184	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	185	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Of vapors that did seem to strangle him.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	186	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	If all the year were playing holidays,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	187	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	To sport would be as tedious as to work,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	188	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But when they seldom come, they wished-for come,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	189	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.

Henry IV, Part I	1	2	192	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	By how much better than my word I am,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	193	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes;

Henry IV, Part I	1	2	195	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault,
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	196	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	197	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
Henry IV, Part I	1	2	198	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I’ll so offend to make offense a skill,

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	207	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	208	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Mighty and to be feared, than my condition,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	209	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	212	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	218	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	219	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	220	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And majesty might never yet endure
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	221	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	222	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	You have good leave to leave us. When we need

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	232	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	233	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	234	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	But I remember, when the fight was done,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	235	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	236	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	237	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dressed,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	238	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	239	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Showed like a stubble land at harvest home.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	240	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He was perfumèd like a milliner,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	241	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	242	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	A pouncet box, which ever and anon
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	243	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He gave his nose and took ’t away again,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	244	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	245	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	246	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	247	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	248	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	249	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	250	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	With many holiday and lady terms
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	251	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	252	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	253	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	254	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To be so pestered with a popinjay,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	255	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Out of my grief and my impatience
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	256	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Answered neglectingly I know not what—
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	257	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He should, or he should not; for he made me mad
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	258	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	259	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	260	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Of guns, and drums, and wounds—God save the mark!—
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	261	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	262	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Was parmacety for an inward bruise,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	263	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And that it was great pity, so it was,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	264	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	This villainous saltpeter should be digged
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	265	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Out of the bowels of the harmless Earth,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	266	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	267	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	So cowardly, and but for these vile guns
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	268	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He would himself have been a soldier.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	269	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	270	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I answered indirectly, as I said,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	271	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And I beseech you, let not his report
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	272	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Come current for an accusation
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	273	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	274	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	The circumstance considered, good my lord,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	275	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	Whate’er Lord Harry Percy then had said
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	276	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	To such a person and in such a place,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	277	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	At such a time, with all the rest retold,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	278	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	May reasonably die and never rise
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	279	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	To do him wrong or any way impeach
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	280	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	281	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	282	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But with proviso and exception
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	283	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	284	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	285	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Who, on my soul, hath willfully betrayed
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	286	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	287	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Against that great magician, damned Glendower,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	288	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	289	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	290	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	291	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Shall we buy treason and indent with fears
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	292	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	293	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	No, on the barren mountains let him starve,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	294	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For I shall never hold that man my friend
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	295	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	296	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	297	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Revolted Mortimer!
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	298	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	299	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	But by the chance of war. To prove that true
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	300	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	301	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Those mouthèd wounds, which valiantly he took
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	302	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	303	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In single opposition hand to hand
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	304	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He did confound the best part of an hour
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	305	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	306	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	307	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	308	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	309	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	310	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	311	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Blood-stainèd with these valiant combatants.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	312	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Never did bare and rotten policy
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	313	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Color her working with such deadly wounds,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	314	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Nor never could the noble Mortimer
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	315	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Receive so many, and all willingly.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	316	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Then let not him be slandered with revolt.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	317	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Thou dost belie him, Percy; thou dost belie him.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	318	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	He never did encounter with Glendower.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	319	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	320	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	348	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Of my wife’s brother, then his cheek looked pale,

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	350	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	351	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaimed

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	353	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	He was; I heard the proclamation.

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	355	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	356	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Upon his Irish expedition;
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	357	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	From whence he, intercepted, did return
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	358	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	To be deposed and shortly murderèd.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	359	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	361	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	362	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	363	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Heir to the crown?
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	364	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	He did; myself did hear it.

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	379	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	That men of your nobility and power
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	380	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	381	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	(As both of you, God pardon it, have done)

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	395	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Peace, cousin, say no more.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	396	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And now I will unclasp a secret book,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	397	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And to your quick-conceiving discontents
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	398	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	399	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	As full of peril and adventurous spirit
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	400	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	As to o’erwalk a current roaring loud
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	401	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	402	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	405	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	407	direction	delivery	Northumberland_R2	, to Worcester
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	408	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Imagination of some great exploit

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	410	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	411	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	412	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	413	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Where fathom line could never touch the ground,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	414	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And pluck up drownèd honor by the locks,

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	416	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Without corrival all her dignities.

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	418	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	He apprehends a world of figures here,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	419	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	But not the form of what he should attend.—
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	420	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	421	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I cry you mercy.

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	425	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	426	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	427	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I’ll keep them, by this hand!
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	428	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	You start away

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	454	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	455	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In Richard’s time—what do you call the place?
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	456	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	A plague upon it! It is in Gloucestershire.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	457	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	’Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	458	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	His uncle York, where I first bowed my knee

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	466	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And “gentle Harry Percy,” and “kind cousin.”

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	470	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	We will stay your leisure.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	471	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I have done, i’ faith.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	472	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners:
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	473	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	474	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And make the Douglas’ son your only mean

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	476	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Which I shall send you written, be assured
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	477	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Will easily be granted.—You, my lord,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	478	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Your son in Scotland being thus employed,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	479	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Shall secretly into the bosom creep

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	485	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	I speak not this in estimation,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	486	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	As what I think might be, but what I know
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	487	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	488	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And only stays but to behold the face
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	489	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	490	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I smell it. Upon my life it will do well.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	491	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	492	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	494	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To join with Mortimer, ha?
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	495	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And so they shall.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	496	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	497	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And ’tis no little reason bids us speed
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	498	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	To save our heads by raising of a head,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	499	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	For bear ourselves as even as we can,
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	500	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	The King will always think him in our debt,

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	502	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Till he hath found a time to pay us home.
Henry IV, Part I	1	3	503	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And see already how he doth begin

Henry IV, Part I	1	3	505	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He does, he does. We’ll be revenged on him.

Henry IV, Part I	2	1	547	speech	prose	Chamberlain_1H4	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there’s a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper—a kind of auditor, one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already and call for eggs and butter. They will away presently.
Henry IV, Part I	2	1	548	speech	prose	Gadshill_1H4	Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas’ clerks, I’ll give thee this neck.

Henry IV, Part I	2	1	550	speech	prose	Gadshill_1H4	What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I’ll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut, there are other Troyans that thou dream’st not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace, that would, if matters should be looked into, for their own credit sake make all whole. I am joined with no foot-land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray, and yet, zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint the commonwealth, or rather not pray to her but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots.

Why, that’s certain. ’Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my Lord Fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.  Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid, our friends true and constant—a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action. Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself, Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month, and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this—an infidel! Ha, you shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to the King and lay open all our proceedings.

Henry IV, Part I	2	4	726	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very bass string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their Christian names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy—by the Lord, so they call me—and when I am king of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep “dyeing scarlet,” and when you breathe in your watering, they cry “Hem!” and bid you “Play it off!” To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action; but, sweet Ned—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than “Eight shillings and sixpence,” and “You are welcome,” with this shrill addition, “Anon, anon, sir.—Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,” or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling “Francis,” that his tale to me may be nothing but “Anon.” Step aside, and I’ll show thee a precedent.

Henry IV, Part I	2	4	819	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Nay, that’s past praying for. I have peppered two of them. Two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits.

And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!

I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my life— I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince.

Henry IV, Part I	2	4	889	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I grant you, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more. Worcester is stolen away tonight. Thy father’s beard is turned white with the news. You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
Henry IV, Part I	2	4	890	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Why then, it is like if there come a hot June, and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hobnails, by the hundreds.
Henry IV, Part I	2	4	891	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	By the Mass, thou sayest true. It is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? Doth not thy blood thrill at it?
Henry IV, Part I	2	4	892	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Not a whit, i’ faith. I lack some of thy instinct.
Henry IV, Part I	2	4	893	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Well, thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father. If thou love me, practice an answer.

Henry IV, Part I	2	4	895	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Shall I? Content.  This chair shall be my state, this dagger my scepter, and this cushion my crown.

Henry IV, Part I	2	4	911	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Peace, good pint-pot. Peace, good tickle-brain.—  Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, so youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it: there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou been this month?
Henry IV, Part I	2	4	916	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my father.

There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man. A tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloakbag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend Vice, that gray iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning but in craft? Wherein crafty but in villainy?

But that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked. If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s company.

Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1276	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That, in His secret doom, out of my blood
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1277	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	He’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1278	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But thou dost in thy passages of life
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1279	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Make me believe that thou art only marked

Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1281	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,

Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1285	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As thou art matched withal, and grafted to,

Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1287	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And hold their level with thy princely heart?
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1288	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	So please your Majesty, I would I could
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1289	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Quit all offenses with as clear excuse
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1290	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1291	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Myself of many I am charged withal.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1292	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Yet such extenuation let me beg
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1293	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	As, in reproof of many tales devised,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1294	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1295	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1296	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I may for some things true, wherein my youth
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1297	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Hath faulty wandered and irregular,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1298	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Find pardon on my true submission.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1299	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	God pardon thee. Yet let me wonder, Harry,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1300	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	At thy affections, which do hold a wing
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1301	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1302	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1303	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1304	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And art almost an alien to the hearts
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1305	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of all the court and princes of my blood.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1306	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The hope and expectation of thy time
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1307	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Is ruined, and the soul of every man
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1308	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Prophetically do forethink thy fall.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1309	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Had I so lavish of my presence been,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1310	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	So common-hackneyed in the eyes of men,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1311	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1312	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1313	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Had still kept loyal to possession
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1314	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And left me in reputeless banishment,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1315	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1316	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	By being seldom seen, I could not stir
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1317	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But like a comet I was wondered at,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1318	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That men would tell their children “This is he.”
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1319	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Others would say “Where? Which is Bolingbroke?”
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1320	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1321	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And dressed myself in such humility
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1322	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1323	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1324	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Even in the presence of the crownèd king.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1325	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1326	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1327	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Ne’er seen but wondered at, and so my state,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1328	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1329	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And won by rareness such solemnity.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1330	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The skipping king, he ambled up and down
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1331	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1332	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1333	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Mingled his royalty with cap’ring fools,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1334	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Had his great name profanèd with their scorns,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1335	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And gave his countenance, against his name,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1336	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1337	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of every beardless vain comparative;
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1338	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Grew a companion to the common streets,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1339	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Enfeoffed himself to popularity,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1340	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That, being daily swallowed by men’s eyes,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1341	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	They surfeited with honey and began
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1342	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1343	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	More than a little is by much too much.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1344	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	So, when he had occasion to be seen,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1345	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1346	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1347	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As, sick and blunted with community,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1348	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Afford no extraordinary gaze
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1349	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Such as is bent on sunlike majesty
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1350	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1351	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1352	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Slept in his face, and rendered such aspect
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1353	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1354	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1355	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1356	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1357	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	With vile participation. Not an eye
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1358	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But is aweary of thy common sight,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1359	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1360	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which now doth that I would not have it do,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1361	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1362	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1363	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Be more myself.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1364	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For all the world
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1365	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As thou art to this hour was Richard then
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1366	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1367	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And even as I was then is Percy now.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1368	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Now, by my scepter, and my soul to boot,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1369	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	He hath more worthy interest to the state
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1370	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Than thou, the shadow of succession.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1371	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For of no right, nor color like to right,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1372	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1373	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Turns head against the lion’s armèd jaws,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1374	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1375	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1376	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1377	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	What never-dying honor hath he got
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1378	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Against renownèd Douglas, whose high deeds,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1379	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1380	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Holds from all soldiers chief majority
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1381	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And military title capital
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1382	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1383	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swaddling clothes,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1384	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1385	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Discomfited great Douglas, ta’en him once,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1386	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Enlargèd him, and made a friend of him,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1387	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1388	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1389	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1390	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The Archbishop’s Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1391	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Capitulate against us and are up.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1392	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1393	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1394	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1395	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1396	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Base inclination, and the start of spleen,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1397	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To fight against me under Percy’s pay,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1398	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1399	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To show how much thou art degenerate.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1400	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Do not think so. You shall not find it so.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1401	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And God forgive them that so much have swayed
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1402	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1403	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I will redeem all this on Percy’s head,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1404	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And, in the closing of some glorious day,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1405	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1406	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	When I will wear a garment all of blood
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1407	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And stain my favors in a bloody mask,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1408	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Which, washed away, shall scour my shame with it.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1409	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And that shall be the day, whene’er it lights,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1410	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That this same child of honor and renown,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1411	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praisèd knight,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1412	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1413	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For every honor sitting on his helm,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1414	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Would they were multitudes, and on my head

Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1417	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1418	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1419	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1420	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And I will call him to so strict account
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1421	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That he shall render every glory up,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1422	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1423	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1424	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	This in the name of God I promise here,
Henry IV, Part I	3	2	1425	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	The which if He be pleased I shall perform,

Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1455	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action? Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s loose gown. I am withered like an old applejohn. Well, I’ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking. I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer’s horse. The inside of a church! Company, villainous company, hath been the spoil of me.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1456	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1457	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why, there is it. Come, sing me a bawdy song, make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be, virtuous enough: swore little; diced not above seven times—a week; went to a bawdy house not above once in a quarter—of an hour; paid money that I borrowed—three or four times; lived well and in good compass; and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1458	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1459	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life. Thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop, but ’tis in the nose of thee. Thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1460	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1461	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	No, I’ll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s-head or a memento mori. I never see thy face but I think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear by thy face. My oath should be “By this fire, that’s God’s angel.” But thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou ran’st up Gad’s Hill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus, or a ball of wildfire, there’s no purchase in money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light. Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern, but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in Europe. I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two-and-thirty years, God reward me for it.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1462	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	’Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!

Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1465	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	How now, Dame Partlet the hen, have you enquired yet who picked my pocket?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1466	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John, do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched, I have enquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1467	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	You lie, hostess. Bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair, and I’ll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go to, you are a woman, go.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1468	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Who, I? No, I defy thee! God’s light, I was never called so in mine own house before.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1469	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Go to, I know you well enough.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1470	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1471	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Dowlas, filthy dowlas. I have given them away to bakers’ wives; they have made bolters of them.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1472	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by-drinkings and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound.

Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1474	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	He had his part of it. Let him pay.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1475	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	He? Alas, he is poor. He hath nothing.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1476	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	How, poor? Look upon his face. What call you rich? Let them coin his nose. Let them coin his cheeks. I’ll not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn but I shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a seal ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1477	direction	delivery	MistressQuickly_1H4	, to Bardolph
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1478	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was copper.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1479	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	How? The Prince is a jack, a sneak-up. ’Sblood, an he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so.

Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1487	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What say’st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1488	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Good my lord, hear me.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1489	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1490	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What say’st thou, Jack?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1491	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	The other night I fell asleep here, behind the arras, and had my pocket picked. This house is turned bawdy house; they pick pockets.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1492	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What didst thou lose, Jack?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1493	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Wilt thou believe me, Hal, three or four bonds of forty pound apiece, and a seal ring of my grandfather’s.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1494	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	A trifle, some eightpenny matter.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1495	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so. And, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouthed man, as he is, and said he would cudgel you.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1496	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What, he did not!
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1497	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1498	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	There’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1499	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Say, what thing, what thing?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1500	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	What thing? Why, a thing to thank God on.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1501	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it! I am an honest man’s wife, and, setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1502	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1503	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1504	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	What beast? Why, an otter.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1505	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	An otter, Sir John. Why an otter?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1506	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why, she’s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1507	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1508	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Thou sayst true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1509	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you owed him a thousand pound.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1510	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1511	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is worth a million; thou owest me thy love.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1512	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Nay, my lord, he called you “jack,” and said he would cudgel you.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1513	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Did I, Bardolph?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1514	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1515	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1516	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I say ’tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1517	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare, but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion’s whelp.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1518	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	And why not as the lion?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1519	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	The King himself is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle break.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1520	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees! But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine. It is all filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy houses, and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will stand to it! You will not pocket up wrong! Art thou not ashamed?
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1521	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty. You confess, then, you picked my pocket.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1522	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	It appears so by the story.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1523	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready breakfast, love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy guests. Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason. Thou seest I am pacified still. Nay, prithee, begone.  Now, Hal, to the news at court. For the robbery, lad, how is that answered?

Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1526	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	O, I do not like that paying back. ’Tis a double labor.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1527	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I am good friends with my father and may do anything.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1528	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou dost, and do it with unwashed hands too.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1529	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Do, my lord.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1530	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
Henry IV, Part I	3	3	1531	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find one that can steal well? O, for a fine thief of the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts! I am heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these rebels. They offend none but the virtuous. I laud them; I praise them.

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1586	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He writes me here that inward sickness—
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1587	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And that his friends by deputation
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1588	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Could not so soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1589	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1590	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	On any soul removed but on his own;
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1591	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1593	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To see how fortune is disposed to us,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1594	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1595	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Because the King is certainly possessed
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1596	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1597	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1598	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off!
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1599	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And yet, in faith, it is not. His present want
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1600	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1604	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	It were not good, for therein should we read
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1605	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	The very bottom and the soul of hope,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1606	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	The very list, the very utmost bound

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1609	speech	verse	Douglas_1H4	A sweet reversion. We may boldly spend
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1610	speech	verse	Douglas_1H4	Upon the hope of what is to come in.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1611	speech	verse	Douglas_1H4	A comfort of retirement lives in this.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1612	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1616	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	The quality and hair of our attempt
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1617	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Brooks no division. It will be thought

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1619	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1620	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1621	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And think how such an apprehension
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1622	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	May turn the tide of fearful faction
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1623	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And breed a kind of question in our cause.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1624	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	For well you know, we of the off’ring side
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1625	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1626	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1627	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	The eye of reason may pry in upon us.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1628	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	This absence of your father’s draws a curtain
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1629	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1630	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Before not dreamt of.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1631	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	You strain too far.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1632	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	I rather of his absence make this use:
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1633	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	It lends a luster and more great opinion,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1634	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	A larger dare, to our great enterprise

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1638	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1640	speech	verse	Douglas_1H4	As heart can think. There is not such a word

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1652	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1653	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1654	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And his comrades, that daffed the world aside
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1655	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And bid it pass?
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1656	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	All furnished, all in arms,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1657	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	All plumed like estridges that with the wind
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1658	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	Bated like eagles having lately bathed,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1659	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	Glittering in golden coats like images,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1660	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	As full of spirit as the month of May,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1661	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1662	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1663	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	I saw young Harry with his beaver on,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1664	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armed,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1665	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1666	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	And vaulted with such ease into his seat
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1667	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1668	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1678	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1680	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1684	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	There is more news.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1685	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	I learned in Worcester, as I rode along,
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1686	speech	verse	Vernon_1H4	He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1687	speech	verse	Douglas_1H4	That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1688	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1689	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	What may the King’s whole battle reach unto?

Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1694	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Come, let us take a muster speedily.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1695	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Doomsday is near. Die all, die merrily.
Henry IV, Part I	4	1	1696	speech	verse	Douglas_1H4	Talk not of dying. I am out of fear

Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1707	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have misused the King’s press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen’s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked twice on the banns—such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins’ heads, and they have bought out their services, and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies—slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton’s dogs licked his sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded, unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers tradefallen, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable-ragged than an old feazed ancient; and such have I to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I’ll not march through Coventry with them, that’s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that’s all one; they’ll find linen enough on every hedge.

Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1710	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	What, Hal, how now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire?—My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy. I thought your Honor had already been at Shrewsbury.
Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1711	speech	prose	Westmoreland_1H4	Faith, Sir John, ’tis more than time that I were there and you too, but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us all. We must away all night.
Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1712	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.
Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1713	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after?

Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1716	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder. They’ll fill a pit as well as better. Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1717	speech	prose	Westmoreland_1H4	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly.
Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1718	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never learned that of me.
Henry IV, Part I	4	2	1719	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No, I’ll be sworn, unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste. Percy is already in the field.

Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1790	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1791	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	My father and my uncle and myself
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1792	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Did give him that same royalty he wears,

Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1794	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Sick in the world’s regard, wretched and low,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1795	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1796	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	My father gave him welcome to the shore;
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1797	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And when he heard him swear and vow to God
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1798	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1799	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To sue his livery, and beg his peace

Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1802	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Swore him assistance and performed it too.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1803	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Now when the lords and barons of the realm
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1804	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1805	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	The more and less came in with cap and knee,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1806	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1807	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1808	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Laid gifts before him, proffered him their oaths,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1809	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Gave him their heirs as pages, followed him
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1810	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1811	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	He presently, as greatness knows itself,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1812	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Steps me a little higher than his vow
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1813	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Made to my father while his blood was poor
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1814	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1815	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And now forsooth takes on him to reform
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1816	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1817	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1818	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1819	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Over his country’s wrongs, and by this face,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1820	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	This seeming brow of justice, did he win
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1821	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	The hearts of all that he did angle for,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1822	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Proceeded further—cut me off the heads
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1823	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Of all the favorites that the absent king
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1824	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In deputation left behind him here

Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1828	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In short time after, he deposed the King,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1829	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Soon after that deprived him of his life

Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1831	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	To make that worse, suffered his kinsman March
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1832	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	(Who is, if every owner were well placed,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1833	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Indeed his king) to be engaged in Wales,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1834	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	There without ransom to lie forfeited,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1835	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Disgraced me in my happy victories,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1836	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Sought to entrap me by intelligence,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1837	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Rated mine uncle from the council board,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1838	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	In rage dismissed my father from the court,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1839	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1840	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And in conclusion drove us to seek out
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1841	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	This head of safety, and withal to pry
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1842	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Into his title, the which we find
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1843	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Too indirect for long continuance.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1844	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	Shall I return this answer to the King?
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1845	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Not so, Sir Walter. We’ll withdraw awhile.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1846	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Go to the King, and let there be impawned
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1847	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Some surety for a safe return again,
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1848	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And in the morning early shall mine uncle
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1849	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Bring him our purposes. And so farewell.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1850	speech	verse	Blunt_1H4	I would you would accept of grace and love.
Henry IV, Part I	4	3	1851	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	And maybe so we shall.

Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1857	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	With wingèd haste to the Lord Marshal,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1858	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1859	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	To whom they are directed. If you knew
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1860	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	How much they do import, you would make haste.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1861	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	My good lord, I guess their tenor.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1862	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Like enough you do.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1863	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1864	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1865	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Must bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1866	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	As I am truly given to understand,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1867	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	The King with mighty and quick-raisèd power
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1868	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Meets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1869	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	What with the sickness of Northumberland,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1870	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Whose power was in the first proportion,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1871	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1872	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Who with them was a rated sinew too
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1873	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And comes not in, o’erruled by prophecies,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1874	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	I fear the power of Percy is too weak
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1875	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	To wage an instant trial with the King.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1876	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	Why, my good lord, you need not fear.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1877	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1878	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	No, Mortimer is not there.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1879	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1880	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1881	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1882	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And so there is. But yet the King hath drawn
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1883	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	The special head of all the land together:
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1884	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1885	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1886	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And many more corrivals and dear men
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1887	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Of estimation and command in arms.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1888	speech	verse	SirMichael_1H4	Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1889	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	I hope no less, yet needful ’tis to fear;
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1890	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1891	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1892	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Dismiss his power he means to visit us,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1893	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	For he hath heard of our confederacy,
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1894	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him.
Henry IV, Part I	4	4	1895	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Therefore make haste. I must go write again

Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1912	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As now we meet. You have deceived our trust
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1913	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And made us doff our easy robes of peace
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1914	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1915	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	This is not well, my lord; this is not well.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1916	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	What say you to it? Will you again unknit

Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1921	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	A prodigy of fear, and a portent
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1922	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of broachèd mischief to the unborn times?
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1923	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Hear me, my liege:
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1924	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	For mine own part I could be well content
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1925	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	To entertain the lag end of my life

Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1927	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	I have not sought the day of this dislike.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1928	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	You have not sought it. How comes it then?
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1929	speech	verse	Falstaff_1H4	Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1931	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	It pleased your Majesty to turn your looks
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1932	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Of favor from myself and all our house;
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1933	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And yet I must remember you, my lord,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1934	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	We were the first and dearest of your friends.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1935	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	For you my staff of office did I break
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1936	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	In Richard’s time, and posted day and night
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1937	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	To meet you on the way and kiss your hand
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1938	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	When yet you were in place and in account
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1939	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1940	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	It was myself, my brother, and his son
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1941	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	That brought you home and boldly did outdare
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1942	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1943	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1944	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	That you did nothing purpose ’gainst the state,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1945	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Nor claim no further than your new-fall’n right,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1946	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1947	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	To this we swore our aid. But in short space
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1948	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	It rained down fortune show’ring on your head,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1949	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And such a flood of greatness fell on you—
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1950	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	What with our help, what with the absent king,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1951	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	What with the injuries of a wanton time,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1952	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1953	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And the contrarious winds that held the King
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1954	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	So long in his unlucky Irish wars
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1955	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	That all in England did repute him dead—
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1956	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And from this swarm of fair advantages
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1957	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	You took occasion to be quickly wooed
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1958	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	To gripe the general sway into your hand,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1959	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster;
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1960	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And being fed by us, you used us so
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1961	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo’s bird,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1962	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Useth the sparrow—did oppress our nest,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1963	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1964	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	That even our love durst not come near your sight
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1965	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1966	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	We were enforced for safety sake to fly
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1967	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Out of your sight and raise this present head,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1968	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Whereby we stand opposèd by such means
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1969	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	As you yourself have forged against yourself
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1970	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1971	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	And violation of all faith and troth
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1972	speech	verse	Worcester_1H4	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1973	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	These things indeed you have articulate,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1974	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Proclaimed at market crosses, read in churches,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1975	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To face the garment of rebellion
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1976	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	With some fine color that may please the eye
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1977	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1978	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1979	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of hurlyburly innovation.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1980	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And never yet did insurrection want
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1981	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Such water colors to impaint his cause,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1982	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Nor moody beggars starving for a time
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1983	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1984	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	In both your armies there is many a soul
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1985	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1986	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,

Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1988	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1989	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	This present enterprise set off his head,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1990	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I do not think a braver gentleman,

Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1992	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	More daring or more bold, is now alive
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1993	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1994	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1995	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I have a truant been to chivalry,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1996	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And so I hear he doth account me too.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1997	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Yet this before my father’s majesty:
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1998	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	I am content that he shall take the odds
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	1999	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Of his great name and estimation,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	2000	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And will, to save the blood on either side,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	2001	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Try fortune with him in a single fight.
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	2002	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	2003	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Albeit considerations infinite
Henry IV, Part I	5	1	2004	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Do make against it.—No, good Worcester, no.

No. Honor hath no skill in surgery, then? No. What is honor? A word. What is in that word “honor”? What is that “honor”? Air. A trim reckoning. Who hath it? He that died o’ Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. ’Tis insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore, I’ll none of it. Honor is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism.

By my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I’ll make him sure, yea, and I’ll swear I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
