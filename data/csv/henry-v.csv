Henry V	1	1	1	direction	entrance	BishopOfEly_H5	Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.
Henry V	1	1	2	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	My lord, I’ll tell you that self bill is urged
Henry V	1	1	3	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Which in th’ eleventh year of the last king’s reign
Henry V	1	1	4	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Was like, and had indeed against us passed
Henry V	1	1	5	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	But that the scambling and unquiet time
Henry V	1	1	6	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Did push it out of farther question.
Henry V	1	1	7	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
Henry V	1	1	8	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
Henry V	1	1	9	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	We lose the better half of our possession,
Henry V	1	1	10	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	For all the temporal lands which men devout
Henry V	1	1	11	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	By testament have given to the Church
Henry V	1	1	12	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Would they strip from us, being valued thus:
Henry V	1	1	13	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	“As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor,
Henry V	1	1	14	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Henry V	1	1	15	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
Henry V	1	1	16	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And, to relief of lazars and weak age
Henry V	1	1	17	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
Henry V	1	1	18	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
Henry V	1	1	19	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And to the coffers of the King besides,
Henry V	1	1	20	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	A thousand pounds by th’ year.” Thus runs the bill.
Henry V	1	1	21	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	This would drink deep.
Henry V	1	1	22	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	’Twould drink the cup and all.
Henry V	1	1	23	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	But what prevention?
Henry V	1	1	24	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The King is full of grace and fair regard.
Henry V	1	1	25	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	And a true lover of the holy Church.
Henry V	1	1	26	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The courses of his youth promised it not.
Henry V	1	1	27	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The breath no sooner left his father’s body
Henry V	1	1	28	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Henry V	1	1	29	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Seemed to die too. Yea, at that very moment
Henry V	1	1	30	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Consideration like an angel came
Henry V	1	1	31	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And whipped th’ offending Adam out of him,
Henry V	1	1	32	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Leaving his body as a paradise
Henry V	1	1	33	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	T’ envelop and contain celestial spirits.
Henry V	1	1	34	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Never was such a sudden scholar made,
Henry V	1	1	35	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Never came reformation in a flood
Henry V	1	1	36	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	With such a heady currance scouring faults,
Henry V	1	1	37	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness
Henry V	1	1	38	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,
Henry V	1	1	39	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As in this king.
Henry V	1	1	40	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	We are blessèd in the change.
Henry V	1	1	41	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Hear him but reason in divinity
Henry V	1	1	42	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And, all-admiring, with an inward wish
Henry V	1	1	43	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	You would desire the King were made a prelate;
Henry V	1	1	44	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
Henry V	1	1	45	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	You would say it hath been all in all his study;
Henry V	1	1	46	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
Henry V	1	1	47	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	A fearful battle rendered you in music;
Henry V	1	1	48	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Turn him to any cause of policy,
Henry V	1	1	49	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
Henry V	1	1	50	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,
Henry V	1	1	51	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The air, a chartered libertine, is still,
Henry V	1	1	52	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears
Henry V	1	1	53	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;
Henry V	1	1	54	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	So that the art and practic part of life
Henry V	1	1	55	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Must be the mistress to this theoric;
Henry V	1	1	56	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,
Henry V	1	1	57	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Since his addiction was to courses vain,
Henry V	1	1	58	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,
Henry V	1	1	59	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,
Henry V	1	1	60	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And never noted in him any study,
Henry V	1	1	61	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Any retirement, any sequestration
Henry V	1	1	62	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	From open haunts and popularity.
Henry V	1	1	63	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
Henry V	1	1	64	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Henry V	1	1	65	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Neighbored by fruit of baser quality;
Henry V	1	1	66	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	And so the Prince obscured his contemplation
Henry V	1	1	67	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,
Henry V	1	1	68	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Henry V	1	1	69	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Unseen yet crescive in his faculty.
Henry V	1	1	70	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	It must be so, for miracles are ceased,
Henry V	1	1	71	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And therefore we must needs admit the means
Henry V	1	1	72	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	How things are perfected.
Henry V	1	1	73	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	But, my good lord,
Henry V	1	1	74	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	How now for mitigation of this bill
Henry V	1	1	75	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty
Henry V	1	1	76	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Incline to it or no?
Henry V	1	1	77	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	He seems indifferent,
Henry V	1	1	78	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Or rather swaying more upon our part
Henry V	1	1	79	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us;
Henry V	1	1	80	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	For I have made an offer to his Majesty—
Henry V	1	1	81	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Upon our spiritual convocation
Henry V	1	1	82	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And in regard of causes now in hand,
Henry V	1	1	83	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Which I have opened to his Grace at large,
Henry V	1	1	84	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As touching France—to give a greater sum
Henry V	1	1	85	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Henry V	1	1	86	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Did to his predecessors part withal.
Henry V	1	1	87	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	How did this offer seem received, my lord?
Henry V	1	1	88	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	With good acceptance of his Majesty—
Henry V	1	1	89	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Save that there was not time enough to hear,
Henry V	1	1	90	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As I perceived his Grace would fain have done,
Henry V	1	1	91	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The severals and unhidden passages
Henry V	1	1	92	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,
Henry V	1	1	93	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And generally to the crown and seat of France,
Henry V	1	1	94	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
Henry V	1	1	95	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	What was th’ impediment that broke this off?
Henry V	1	1	96	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The French ambassador upon that instant
Henry V	1	1	97	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Craved audience. And the hour, I think, is come
Henry V	1	1	98	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To give him hearing. Is it four o’clock?
Henry V	1	1	99	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	It is.
Henry V	1	1	100	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Then go we in to know his embassy,
Henry V	1	1	101	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Which I could with a ready guess declare
Henry V	1	1	102	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
Henry V	1	1	103	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

Henry V	1	2	108	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Send for him, good uncle.
Henry V	1	2	109	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Shall we call in th’ Ambassador, my liege?
Henry V	1	2	110	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,
Henry V	1	2	111	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Before we hear him, of some things of weight
Henry V	1	2	112	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That task our thoughts concerning us and France.

Henry V	1	2	114	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	God and his angels guard your sacred throne
Henry V	1	2	115	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And make you long become it.
Henry V	1	2	116	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Sure we thank you.
Henry V	1	2	117	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed
Henry V	1	2	118	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And justly and religiously unfold
Henry V	1	2	119	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Why the law Salic that they have in France
Henry V	1	2	120	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Or should or should not bar us in our claim.
Henry V	1	2	121	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
Henry V	1	2	122	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Henry V	1	2	123	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Or nicely charge your understanding soul
Henry V	1	2	124	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Henry V	1	2	125	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Suits not in native colors with the truth;
Henry V	1	2	126	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For God doth know how many now in health
Henry V	1	2	127	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Shall drop their blood in approbation
Henry V	1	2	128	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Henry V	1	2	129	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
Henry V	1	2	130	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	How you awake our sleeping sword of war.
Henry V	1	2	131	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	We charge you in the name of God, take heed,
Henry V	1	2	132	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For never two such kingdoms did contend
Henry V	1	2	133	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops
Henry V	1	2	134	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
Henry V	1	2	135	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
Henry V	1	2	136	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That makes such waste in brief mortality.
Henry V	1	2	137	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,
Henry V	1	2	138	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For we will hear, note, and believe in heart
Henry V	1	2	139	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That what you speak is in your conscience washed
Henry V	1	2	140	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	As pure as sin with baptism.
Henry V	1	2	141	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers
Henry V	1	2	142	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	That owe yourselves, your lives, and services
Henry V	1	2	143	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To this imperial throne. There is no bar
Henry V	1	2	144	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To make against your Highness’ claim to France
Henry V	1	2	145	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	But this, which they produce from Pharamond:
Henry V	1	2	146	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	“In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant”
Henry V	1	2	147	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	(No woman shall succeed in Salic land),
Henry V	1	2	148	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze
Henry V	1	2	149	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
Henry V	1	2	150	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The founder of this law and female bar.
Henry V	1	2	151	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
Henry V	1	2	152	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	That the land Salic is in Germany,
Henry V	1	2	153	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,
Henry V	1	2	154	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
Henry V	1	2	155	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	There left behind and settled certain French,
Henry V	1	2	156	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Who, holding in disdain the German women
Henry V	1	2	157	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	For some dishonest manners of their life,
Henry V	1	2	158	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Established then this law: to wit, no female
Henry V	1	2	159	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Should be inheritrix in Salic land,
Henry V	1	2	160	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Which “Salic,” as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala
Henry V	1	2	161	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.
Henry V	1	2	162	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Then doth it well appear the Salic law
Henry V	1	2	163	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Was not devisèd for the realm of France,
Henry V	1	2	164	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Nor did the French possess the Salic land
Henry V	1	2	165	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Until four hundred one and twenty years
Henry V	1	2	166	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	After defunction of King Pharamond,
Henry V	1	2	167	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Idly supposed the founder of this law,
Henry V	1	2	168	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Who died within the year of our redemption
Henry V	1	2	169	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Henry V	1	2	170	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French
Henry V	1	2	171	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Beyond the river Sala in the year
Henry V	1	2	172	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
Henry V	1	2	173	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	King Pepin, which deposèd Childeric,
Henry V	1	2	174	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Did, as heir general, being descended
Henry V	1	2	175	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Henry V	1	2	176	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Henry V	1	2	177	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
Henry V	1	2	178	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Henry V	1	2	179	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
Henry V	1	2	180	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To find his title with some shows of truth,
Henry V	1	2	181	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
Henry V	1	2	182	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Conveyed himself as th’ heir to th’ Lady Lingare,
Henry V	1	2	183	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son
Henry V	1	2	184	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son
Henry V	1	2	185	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Henry V	1	2	186	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Henry V	1	2	187	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Henry V	1	2	188	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
Henry V	1	2	189	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Henry V	1	2	190	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Henry V	1	2	191	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:
Henry V	1	2	192	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Henry V	1	2	193	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Was reunited to the crown of France.
Henry V	1	2	194	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,
Henry V	1	2	195	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,
Henry V	1	2	196	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
Henry V	1	2	197	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To hold in right and title of the female.
Henry V	1	2	198	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	So do the kings of France unto this day,
Henry V	1	2	199	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law
Henry V	1	2	200	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To bar your Highness claiming from the female,
Henry V	1	2	201	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And rather choose to hide them in a net
Henry V	1	2	202	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Henry V	1	2	203	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Usurped from you and your progenitors.
Henry V	1	2	204	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	May I with right and conscience make this claim?
Henry V	1	2	205	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,
Henry V	1	2	206	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:
Henry V	1	2	207	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	“When the man dies, let the inheritance
Henry V	1	2	208	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord,
Henry V	1	2	209	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,
Henry V	1	2	210	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Look back into your mighty ancestors.
Henry V	1	2	211	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb,
Henry V	1	2	212	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit
Henry V	1	2	213	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,
Henry V	1	2	214	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Who on the French ground played a tragedy,
Henry V	1	2	215	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Making defeat on the full power of France
Henry V	1	2	216	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Henry V	1	2	217	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp
Henry V	1	2	218	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Forage in blood of French nobility.
Henry V	1	2	219	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	O noble English, that could entertain
Henry V	1	2	220	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	With half their forces the full pride of France
Henry V	1	2	221	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And let another half stand laughing by,
Henry V	1	2	222	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	All out of work and cold for action!
Henry V	1	2	223	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
Henry V	1	2	224	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
Henry V	1	2	225	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	You are their heir, you sit upon their throne,
Henry V	1	2	226	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	The blood and courage that renownèd them
Henry V	1	2	227	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Henry V	1	2	228	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Henry V	1	2	229	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
Henry V	1	2	230	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Your brother kings and monarchs of the Earth
Henry V	1	2	231	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
Henry V	1	2	232	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	As did the former lions of your blood.
Henry V	1	2	233	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	They know your Grace hath cause and means and might;
Henry V	1	2	234	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	So hath your Highness. Never king of England
Henry V	1	2	235	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects,
Henry V	1	2	236	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
Henry V	1	2	237	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
Henry V	1	2	238	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
Henry V	1	2	239	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	With blood and sword and fire to win your right,
Henry V	1	2	240	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Henry V	1	2	241	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
Henry V	1	2	242	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As never did the clergy at one time
Henry V	1	2	243	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Bring in to any of your ancestors.
Henry V	1	2	244	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	We must not only arm t’ invade the French,
Henry V	1	2	245	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But lay down our proportions to defend
Henry V	1	2	246	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
Henry V	1	2	247	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	With all advantages.
Henry V	1	2	248	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Henry V	1	2	249	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Henry V	1	2	250	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
Henry V	1	2	251	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
Henry V	1	2	252	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Henry V	1	2	253	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.
Henry V	1	2	254	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Henry V	1	2	255	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Never went with his forces into France
Henry V	1	2	256	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom
Henry V	1	2	257	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Came pouring like the tide into a breach
Henry V	1	2	258	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	With ample and brim fullness of his force,
Henry V	1	2	259	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Galling the gleanèd land with hot assays,
Henry V	1	2	260	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,
Henry V	1	2	261	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That England, being empty of defense,
Henry V	1	2	262	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Hath shook and trembled at th’ ill neighborhood.
Henry V	1	2	263	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	She hath been then more feared than harmed, my liege,
Henry V	1	2	264	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	For hear her but exampled by herself:
Henry V	1	2	265	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	When all her chivalry hath been in France
Henry V	1	2	266	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
Henry V	1	2	267	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	She hath herself not only well defended
Henry V	1	2	268	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	But taken and impounded as a stray
Henry V	1	2	269	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The King of Scots, whom she did send to France
Henry V	1	2	270	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings
Henry V	1	2	271	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	And make her chronicle as rich with praise
Henry V	1	2	272	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
Henry V	1	2	273	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.
Henry V	1	2	274	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	But there’s a saying very old and true:
Henry V	1	2	275	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	“If that you will France win,
Henry V	1	2	276	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Then with Scotland first begin.”
Henry V	1	2	277	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	For once the eagle England being in prey,
Henry V	1	2	278	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Henry V	1	2	279	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
Henry V	1	2	280	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
Henry V	1	2	281	speech	verse	BishopOfEly_H5	To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.
Henry V	1	2	282	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	It follows, then, the cat must stay at home.
Henry V	1	2	283	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Yet that is but a crushed necessity,
Henry V	1	2	284	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
Henry V	1	2	285	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
Henry V	1	2	286	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad,
Henry V	1	2	287	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Th’ advisèd head defends itself at home.
Henry V	1	2	288	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	For government, though high and low and lower,
Henry V	1	2	289	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Henry V	1	2	290	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Henry V	1	2	291	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Like music.
Henry V	1	2	292	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Therefore doth heaven divide
Henry V	1	2	293	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The state of man in divers functions,
Henry V	1	2	294	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Setting endeavor in continual motion,
Henry V	1	2	295	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To which is fixèd as an aim or butt
Henry V	1	2	296	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Obedience; for so work the honeybees,
Henry V	1	2	297	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
Henry V	1	2	298	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
Henry V	1	2	299	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	They have a king and officers of sorts,
Henry V	1	2	300	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Where some like magistrates correct at home,
Henry V	1	2	301	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Others like merchants venture trade abroad,
Henry V	1	2	302	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Others like soldiers armèd in their stings

Henry V	1	2	305	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To the tent royal of their emperor,
Henry V	1	2	306	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
Henry V	1	2	307	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The singing masons building roofs of gold,
Henry V	1	2	308	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
Henry V	1	2	309	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Henry V	1	2	310	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,

Henry V	1	2	312	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Delivering o’er to executors pale
Henry V	1	2	313	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	The lazy yawning drone. I this infer:
Henry V	1	2	314	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	That many things, having full reference
Henry V	1	2	315	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	To one consent, may work contrariously,
Henry V	1	2	316	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As many arrows loosèd several ways
Henry V	1	2	317	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town,
Henry V	1	2	318	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,
Henry V	1	2	319	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	As many lines close in the dial’s center,
Henry V	1	2	320	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
Henry V	1	2	321	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	End in one purpose and be all well borne
Henry V	1	2	322	speech	verse	BishopOfCanterbury_H5	Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!

Henry V	1	2	356	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.
Henry V	1	2	357	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Thus, then, in few:
Henry V	1	2	358	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Your Highness, lately sending into France,
Henry V	1	2	359	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
Henry V	1	2	360	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third;
Henry V	1	2	361	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	In answer of which claim, the Prince our master
Henry V	1	2	362	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Says that you savor too much of your youth
Henry V	1	2	363	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	And bids you be advised there’s naught in France
Henry V	1	2	364	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	That can be with a nimble galliard won;
Henry V	1	2	365	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
Henry V	1	2	366	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
Henry V	1	2	367	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	This tun of treasure and, in lieu of this,
Henry V	1	2	368	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Henry V	1	2	369	speech	verse	AMBASSADORS.0.1_H5	Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
Henry V	1	2	370	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	What treasure, uncle?
Henry V	1	2	371	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Tennis balls, my liege.
Henry V	1	2	372	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
Henry V	1	2	373	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	His present and your pains we thank you for.
Henry V	1	2	374	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	When we have matched our rackets to these balls,
Henry V	1	2	375	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set
Henry V	1	2	376	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.
Henry V	1	2	377	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
Henry V	1	2	378	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That all the courts of France will be disturbed
Henry V	1	2	379	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	With chases. And we understand him well,
Henry V	1	2	380	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	How he comes o’er us with our wilder days,
Henry V	1	2	381	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Not measuring what use we made of them.
Henry V	1	2	382	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	We never valued this poor seat of England,
Henry V	1	2	383	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
Henry V	1	2	384	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common
Henry V	1	2	385	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That men are merriest when they are from home.
Henry V	1	2	386	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Henry V	1	2	387	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness
Henry V	1	2	388	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	When I do rouse me in my throne of France,
Henry V	1	2	389	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	For that I have laid by my majesty
Henry V	1	2	390	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And plodded like a man for working days;
Henry V	1	2	391	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But I will rise there with so full a glory
Henry V	1	2	392	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Henry V	1	2	393	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
Henry V	1	2	394	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Henry V	1	2	395	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Hath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soul
Henry V	1	2	396	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Shall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeance
Henry V	1	2	397	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows
Henry V	1	2	398	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,
Henry V	1	2	399	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
Henry V	1	2	400	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And some are yet ungotten and unborn

Henry V	1	2	406	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.
Henry V	1	2	407	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin

Henry V	2	2	581	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	To furnish him with all appurtenants
Henry V	2	2	582	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Belonging to his honor, and this man

Henry V	2	2	589	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?
Henry V	2	2	590	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
Henry V	2	2	591	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,
Henry V	2	2	592	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	That almost mightst have coined me into gold,

Henry V	2	2	599	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Treason and murder ever kept together,

Henry V	2	2	612	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,
Henry V	2	2	613	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Henry V	2	2	614	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
Henry V	2	2	615	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus
Henry V	2	2	616	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,

Henry V	2	2	624	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?
Henry V	2	2	625	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
Henry V	2	2	626	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Henry V	2	2	627	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Henry V	2	2	628	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Garnished and decked in modest complement,

Henry V	2	2	631	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.
Henry V	2	2	632	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot

He made a finer end, and went away an it had been any christom child. He parted ev’n just between twelve and one, ev’n at the turning o’ th’ tide; for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his finger’s end, I knew there was but one way, for his nose was as sharp as a pen and he talked of green fields. “How now, Sir John?” quoth I. “What, man, be o’ good cheer!” So he cried out “God, God, God!” three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think of God; I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone. Then I felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold as any stone.

Henry V	2	4	746	speech	verse	Constable_H5	You are too much mistaken in this king.

Henry V	2	4	757	speech	verse	Dauphin_H5	Well, ’tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
Henry V	2	4	758	speech	verse	Dauphin_H5	But though we think it so, it is no matter.
Henry V	2	4	759	speech	verse	Dauphin_H5	In cases of defense, ’tis best to weigh
Henry V	2	4	760	speech	verse	Dauphin_H5	The enemy more mighty than he seems.

For indeed three such antics do not amount to a man: for Bardolph, he is white-livered and red-faced, by the means whereof he faces it out but fights not; for Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword, by the means whereof he breaks words and keeps whole weapons; for Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest he should be thought a coward, but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds, for he never broke any man’s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.

Henry V	3	4	1041	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	De nailes. Écoutez. Dites-moi si je parle bien: de hand, de fingres, et de nailes.
Henry V	3	4	1042	speech	prose	Alice_H5	C’est bien dit, madame. Il est fort bon anglais.

Henry V	3	4	1065	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Le foot, et le count. Ô Seigneur Dieu! Ils sont les mots de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les dames d’honneur d’user.

Henry V	3	6	1142	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	I assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridge.
Henry V	3	6	1143	speech	prose	Gower_H5	Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
Henry V	3	6	1144	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power. He is not, God be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge; I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation in the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.
Henry V	3	6	1145	speech	prose	Gower_H5	What do you call him?

Henry V	3	6	1151	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.
Henry V	3	6	1152	speech	prose	Pistol_2H4	Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart and of buxom valor, hath, by cruel Fate and giddy Fortune’s furious fickle wheel, that goddess blind, that stands upon the rolling restless stone—
Henry V	3	6	1153	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant, and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.
Henry V	3	6	1154	speech	prose	Pistol_2H4	Fortune is Bardolph’s foe and frowns on him, for he hath stolen a pax and hangèd must he be. A damnèd death! Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free, and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate. But Exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little price. Therefore go speak; the Duke will hear thy voice, and let not Bardolph’s vital thread be cut with edge of penny cord and vile reproach. Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
Henry V	3	6	1155	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
Henry V	3	6	1156	speech	prose	Pistol_2H4	Why then, rejoice therefore.
Henry V	3	6	1157	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at, for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution, for discipline ought to be used.
Henry V	3	6	1158	speech	prose	Pistol_2H4	Die and be damned, and figo for thy friendship!
Henry V	3	6	1159	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	It is well.

Henry V	3	6	1164	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	I’ll assure you he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day. But it is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.
Henry V	3	6	1165	speech	prose	Gower_H5	Why, ’tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier; and such fellows are perfect in the great commanders’ names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done—at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be marvelously mistook.
Henry V	3	6	1166	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	I tell you what, Captain Gower. I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him my mind.

Henry V	3	6	1171	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge. The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th’ athversary was have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a prave man.
Henry V	3	6	1172	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What men have you lost, Fluellen?
Henry V	3	6	1173	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	The perdition of th’ athversary hath been very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o’ fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire’s out.
Henry V	3	6	1174	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	We would have all such offenders so cut off; and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.

Henry V	3	6	1180	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Unfold it.
Henry V	3	6	1181	speech	prose	Montjoy_H5	Thus says my king: “Say thou to Harry of England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep. Advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th’ effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this, add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced.” So far my king and master; so much my office.
Henry V	3	6	1182	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	What is thy name? I know thy quality.

Henry V	3	7	1222	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Tut, I have the best armor of the world. Would it were day!
Henry V	3	7	1223	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	You have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
Henry V	3	7	1224	speech	prose	Constable_H5	It is the best horse of Europe.
Henry V	3	7	1225	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	Will it never be morning?
Henry V	3	7	1226	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	My Lord of Orléans and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?
Henry V	3	7	1227	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
Henry V	3	7	1228	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. Çà, ha! He bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs, le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui a les narines de feu. When I bestride him, I soar; I am a hawk; he trots the air. The earth sings when he touches it. The basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
Henry V	3	7	1229	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	He’s of the color of the nutmeg.
Henry V	3	7	1230	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus. He is pure air and fire, and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.
Henry V	3	7	1231	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
Henry V	3	7	1232	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.
Henry V	3	7	1233	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	No more, cousin.
Henry V	3	7	1234	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea. Turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. ’Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on, and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: “Wonder of nature—”
Henry V	3	7	1235	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress.
Henry V	3	7	1236	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.
Henry V	3	7	1237	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	Your mistress bears well.
Henry V	3	7	1238	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	Me well—which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress.
Henry V	3	7	1239	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.
Henry V	3	7	1240	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	So perhaps did yours.
Henry V	3	7	1241	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Mine was not bridled.
Henry V	3	7	1242	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	O, then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in your strait strossers.
Henry V	3	7	1243	speech	prose	Constable_H5	You have good judgment in horsemanship.
Henry V	3	7	1244	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my mistress.
Henry V	3	7	1245	speech	prose	Constable_H5	I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
Henry V	3	7	1246	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
Henry V	3	7	1247	speech	prose	Constable_H5	I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress.
Henry V	3	7	1248	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	“Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie lavée au bourbier.” Thou mak’st use of anything.
Henry V	3	7	1249	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
Henry V	3	7	1250	speech	prose	Rambures_H5	My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?
Henry V	3	7	1251	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Stars, my lord.
Henry V	3	7	1252	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
Henry V	3	7	1253	speech	prose	Constable_H5	And yet my sky shall not want.
Henry V	3	7	1254	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and ’twere more honor some were away.
Henry V	3	7	1255	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Ev’n as your horse bears your praises— who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted.
Henry V	3	7	1256	speech	prose	Dauphin_H5	Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will it never be day? I will trot tomorrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.
Henry V	3	7	1257	speech	prose	Constable_H5	I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of my way. But I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears of the English.
Henry V	3	7	1258	speech	prose	Rambures_H5	Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
Henry V	3	7	1259	speech	prose	Constable_H5	You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them.

Henry V	3	7	1264	speech	prose	Constable_H5	I think he will eat all he kills.
Henry V	3	7	1265	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant prince.
Henry V	3	7	1266	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
Henry V	3	7	1267	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
Henry V	3	7	1268	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
Henry V	3	7	1269	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	He never did harm, that I heard of.
Henry V	3	7	1270	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Nor will do none tomorrow. He will keep that good name still.
Henry V	3	7	1271	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	I know him to be valiant.
Henry V	3	7	1272	speech	prose	Constable_H5	I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
Henry V	3	7	1273	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	What’s he?
Henry V	3	7	1274	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Marry, he told me so himself, and he said he cared not who knew it.
Henry V	3	7	1275	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	He needs not. It is no hidden virtue in him.
Henry V	3	7	1276	speech	prose	Constable_H5	By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody saw it but his lackey. ’Tis a hooded valor, and when it appears, it will bate.
Henry V	3	7	1277	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	Ill will never said well.
Henry V	3	7	1278	speech	prose	Constable_H5	I will cap that proverb with “There is flattery in friendship.”
Henry V	3	7	1279	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	And I will take up that with “Give the devil his due.”
Henry V	3	7	1280	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Well placed; there stands your friend for the devil. Have at the very eye of that proverb with “A pox of the devil.”
Henry V	3	7	1281	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	You are the better at proverbs, by how much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot.”
Henry V	3	7	1282	speech	prose	Constable_H5	You have shot over.

Henry V	3	7	1288	speech	prose	Constable_H5	A valiant and most expert gentleman.— Would it were day! Alas, poor Harry of England! He longs not for the dawning as we do.
Henry V	3	7	1289	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out of his knowledge.
Henry V	3	7	1290	speech	prose	Constable_H5	If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
Henry V	3	7	1291	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	That they lack; for if their heads had any intellectual armor, they could never wear such heavy headpieces.
Henry V	3	7	1292	speech	prose	Rambures_H5	That island of England breeds very valiant creatures. Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
Henry V	3	7	1293	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples. You may as well say that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
Henry V	3	7	1294	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their wives. And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
Henry V	3	7	1295	speech	prose	Orleans_H5	Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
Henry V	3	7	1296	speech	prose	Constable_H5	Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shall we about it?

Henry V	4	1	1383	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Bates_H5	He hath not told his thought to the King?
Henry V	4	1	1384	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No. Nor it is not meet he should, for, though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.
Henry V	4	1	1385	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Bates_H5	He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.

Henry V	4	1	1388	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds. Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.

Henry V	4	1	1390	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Bates_H5	Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know enough if we know we are the King’s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.
Henry V	4	1	1391	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Williams_H5	But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it, who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.
Henry V	4	1	1392	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him. Or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here men are punished for before-breach of the King’s laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the King’s, but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained. And in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.
Henry V	4	1	1393	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Williams_H5	’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head; the King is not to answer it.
Henry V	4	1	1394	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Bates_H5	I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
Henry V	4	1	1395	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I myself heard the King say he would not be ransomed.
Henry V	4	1	1396	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Williams_H5	Ay, he said so to make us fight cheerfully, but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed and we ne’er the wiser.
Henry V	4	1	1397	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
Henry V	4	1	1398	speech	prose	SOLDIERS.ENGLISH.Williams_H5	You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun, that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch. You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather. You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.
Henry V	4	1	1399	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Your reproof is something too round. I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.

Henry V	4	1	1403	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet. Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.

Henry V	4	1	1410	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the King’s company.

Henry V	4	1	1413	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders. But it is no English treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the King himself will be a clipper.

Henry V	4	7	1827	speech	prose	Gower_H5	’Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha’ done this slaughter. Besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the King’s tent, wherefore the King, most worthily, hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat. O, ’tis a gallant king!
Henry V	4	7	1828	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What call you the town’s name where Alexander the Pig was born?

Henry V	4	7	1831	speech	prose	Gower_H5	I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon. His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
Henry V	4	7	1832	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the ’orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river. But ’tis all one; ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.

Henry V	4	7	1834	speech	prose	Fluellen_H5	It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth, being in his right wits and his good judgments, turned away the fat knight with the great-belly doublet; he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries and mocks—I have forgot his name.

Henry V	5	2	2191	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to affirm it.
Henry V	5	2	2192	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Ô bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
Henry V	5	2	2193	direction	delivery	HenryV_H5	, to Alice
Henry V	5	2	2194	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Henry V	5	2	2195	speech	prose	Alice_H5	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits; dat is de Princess.
Henry V	5	2	2196	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	The Princess is the better Englishwoman.— I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say “I love you.” Then if you urge me farther than to say “Do you, in faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i’ faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?
Henry V	5	2	2197	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
Henry V	5	2	2198	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me. For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation, only downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me. And take me, take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
Henry V	5	2	2199	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
Henry V	5	2	2200	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
Henry V	5	2	2201	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	I cannot tell wat is dat.
Henry V	5	2	2202	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi—let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!—donc vôtre est France, et vous êtes mienne. It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.
Henry V	5	2	2203	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous parlez, il est meilleur que l’anglais lequel je parle.
Henry V	5	2	2204	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No, faith, is ’t not, Kate, but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English? Canst thou love me?
Henry V	5	2	2205	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	I cannot tell.
Henry V	5	2	2206	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I’ll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate, you will, to her, dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower de luce?
Henry V	5	2	2207	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	I do not know dat.
Henry V	5	2	2208	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety, take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très cher et divin déesse?
Henry V	5	2	2209	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Your Majesté ’ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
Henry V	5	2	2210	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Now fie upon my false French. By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now beshrew my father’s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear. My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say “Harry of England, I am thine,” which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud “England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine,” who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and thy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt thou have me?
Henry V	5	2	2211	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Dat is as it shall please de roi mon père.
Henry V	5	2	2212	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.

Henry V	5	2	2215	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur, en baisant la main d’ une—Notre Seigneur!— indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon très puissant seigneur.
Henry V	5	2	2216	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
Henry V	5	2	2217	speech	prose	Katherine_H5	Les dames et demoiselles, pour être baisées devant leurs noces, il n’est pas la coutume de France.

Henry V	5	2	2219	speech	prose	Alice_H5	Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish.

Henry V	5	2	2223	speech	prose	Alice_H5	Oui, vraiment.
Henry V	5	2	2224	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss. Therefore, patiently and yielding. You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council, and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs.

Henry V	5	2	2229	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
Henry V	5	2	2230	speech	prose	Burgundy_H5	Is she not apt?
Henry V	5	2	2231	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.
Henry V	5	2	2232	speech	prose	Burgundy_H5	Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.
Henry V	5	2	2233	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
Henry V	5	2	2234	speech	prose	Burgundy_H5	They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do.
Henry V	5	2	2235	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
Henry V	5	2	2236	speech	prose	Burgundy_H5	I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning, for maids well summered and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their eyes; and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.
Henry V	5	2	2237	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer. And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.
Henry V	5	2	2238	speech	prose	Burgundy_H5	As love is, my lord, before it loves.
Henry V	5	2	2239	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	It is so. And you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
Henry V	5	2	2240	speech	prose	KingOfFrance_H5	Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turned into a maid, for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered.
Henry V	5	2	2241	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Shall Kate be my wife?
Henry V	5	2	2242	speech	prose	KingOfFrance_H5	So please you.

Henry V	5	2	2244	speech	verse	KingOfFrance_H5	We have consented to all terms of reason.
Henry V	5	2	2245	speech	verse	HenryV_H5	Is ’t so, my lords of England?
