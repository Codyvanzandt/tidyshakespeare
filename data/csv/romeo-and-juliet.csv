Romeo and Juliet	1	1	100	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Here were the servants of your adversary,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	101	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	102	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	I drew to part them. In the instant came
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	103	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	104	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	105	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	106	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	107	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	108	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	109	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	110	speech	verse	LadyMontague_Rom	O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	111	speech	verse	LadyMontague_Rom	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	112	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	113	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Peered forth the golden window of the east,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	114	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	115	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Where underneath the grove of sycamore
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	116	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	That westward rooteth from this city side,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	117	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	So early walking did I see your son.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	118	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Towards him I made, but he was ’ware of me
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	119	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	And stole into the covert of the wood.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	120	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	I, measuring his affections by my own
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	121	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	(Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	122	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Being one too many by my weary self),
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	123	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	124	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	125	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	126	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	127	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	128	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	129	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	130	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	131	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Away from light steals home my heavy son
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	132	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	And private in his chamber pens himself,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	133	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	134	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	And makes himself an artificial night.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	135	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Black and portentous must this humor prove,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	136	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	137	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	138	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	139	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Have you importuned him by any means?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	140	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Both by myself and many other friends.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	141	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	But he, his own affections’ counselor,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	142	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Is to himself—I will not say how true,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	143	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	But to himself so secret and so close,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	144	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	So far from sounding and discovery,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	145	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	146	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	147	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	148	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	149	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	We would as willingly give cure as know.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	150	direction	entrance	Romeo_Rom	Enter Romeo.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	151	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	152	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	153	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	154	speech	verse	Montague_Rom	To hear true shrift.—Come, madam, let’s away.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	155	direction	exit	Montague_Rom	Montague and Lady Montague exit.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	155	direction	exit	LadyMontague_Rom	Montague and Lady Montague exit.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	156	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Good morrow, cousin.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	157	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Is the day so young?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	158	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	But new struck nine.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	159	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Ay me, sad hours seem long.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	160	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	161	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	162	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	163	speech	prose	Benvolio_Rom	In love?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	164	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	Out—
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	165	speech	prose	Benvolio_Rom	Of love?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	166	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Out of her favor where I am in love.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	167	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	168	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	169	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	170	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	171	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Where shall we dine?—O me! What fray was here?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	172	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	173	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	174	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	175	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	O anything of nothing first create!
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	176	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	177	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	178	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	179	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	180	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	181	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Dost thou not laugh?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	182	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	No, coz, I rather weep.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	183	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Good heart, at what?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	184	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	At thy good heart’s oppression.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	185	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Why, such is love’s transgression.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	186	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	187	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	188	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	189	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	190	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	191	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	192	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	193	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	What is it else? A madness most discreet,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	194	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	195	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Farewell, my coz.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	196	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Soft, I will go along.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	197	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	198	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	199	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	This is not Romeo. He’s some other where.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	200	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	201	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	202	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	203	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	A sick man in sadness makes his will—
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	204	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	205	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	206	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	207	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	A right good markman! And she’s fair I love.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	208	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	209	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Well in that hit you miss. She’ll not be hit
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	210	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	With Cupid’s arrow. She hath Dian’s wit,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	211	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	212	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
Romeo and Juliet	1	1	213	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,

Romeo and Juliet	1	3	362	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	363	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,

Romeo and Juliet	1	3	369	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	370	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	“Shake,” quoth the dovehouse. ’Twas no need, I trow,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	371	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	To bid me trudge.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	372	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	And since that time it is eleven years.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	373	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th’ rood,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	374	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	She could have run and waddled all about,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	375	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	For even the day before, she broke her brow,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	376	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	And then my husband (God be with his soul,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	377	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	He was a merry man) took up the child.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	378	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	“Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	379	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	380	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Wilt thou not, Jule?” And, by my holidam,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	381	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	382	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	To see now how a jest shall come about!
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	383	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,

Romeo and Juliet	1	3	385	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	386	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	387	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	388	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	To think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	389	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	390	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	A bump as big as a young cock’rel’s stone,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	391	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	392	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	“Yea,” quoth my husband. “Fall’st upon thy face?
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	393	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	394	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “Ay.”

Romeo and Juliet	1	3	400	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	Marry, that “marry” is the very theme
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	401	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	I came to talk of.—Tell me, daughter Juliet,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	402	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	How stands your disposition to be married?
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	403	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	It is an honor that I dream not of.
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	404	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	An honor? Were not I thine only nurse,
Romeo and Juliet	1	3	405	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat.

Romeo and Juliet	1	3	407	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,

Romeo and Juliet	1	4	457	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	458	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	459	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	460	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	461	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	You are a lover. Borrow Cupid’s wings

Romeo and Juliet	1	4	465	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	466	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	467	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And to sink in it should you burden love—
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	468	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	469	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	470	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Too rude, too boist’rous, and it pricks like thorn.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	471	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	472	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.—
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	473	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Give me a case to put my visage in.—
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	474	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	A visor for a visor. What care I

Romeo and Juliet	1	4	480	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	481	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase:
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	482	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I’ll be a candle holder and look on;
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	483	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.

Romeo and Juliet	1	4	488	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Nay, that’s not so.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	489	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	I mean, sir, in delay
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	490	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	We waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	491	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	492	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	493	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And we mean well in going to this masque,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	494	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	But ’tis no wit to go.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	495	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Why, may one ask?
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	496	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I dreamt a dream tonight.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	497	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And so did I.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	498	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Well, what was yours?
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	499	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	That dreamers often lie.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	500	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	501	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	502	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	503	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	In shape no bigger than an agate stone
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	504	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	On the forefinger of an alderman,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	505	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Drawn with a team of little atomi
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	506	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	507	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	508	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	509	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Her traces of the smallest spider web,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	510	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	511	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	512	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	513	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Not half so big as a round little worm
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	514	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	515	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	516	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	517	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	518	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And in this state she gallops night by night
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	519	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	520	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	On courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	521	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	522	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	523	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	524	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	525	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	526	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	527	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	528	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep;
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	529	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Then he dreams of another benefice.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	530	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	531	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	532	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	533	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	534	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	535	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	536	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	537	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	That plats the manes of horses in the night
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	538	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	539	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	540	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	541	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	542	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Making them women of good carriage.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	543	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	This is she—
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	544	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	545	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Thou talk’st of nothing.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	546	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	True, I talk of dreams,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	547	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Which are the children of an idle brain,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	548	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	549	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Which is as thin of substance as the air
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	550	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	551	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Even now the frozen bosom of the north
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	552	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	553	speech	verse	Mercutio_Rom	Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	554	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	555	speech	verse	Benvolio_Rom	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	556	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I fear too early, for my mind misgives
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	557	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	558	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
Romeo and Juliet	1	4	559	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	With this night’s revels, and expire the term

Romeo and Juliet	2	2	853	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	854	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	855	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	856	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	857	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	858	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye

Romeo and Juliet	2	2	867	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	868	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	869	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	870	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	871	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I should adventure for such merchandise.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	872	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	873	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	874	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	875	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	876	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	What I have spoke. But farewell compliment.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	877	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say “Ay,”
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	878	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	879	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	880	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	881	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	882	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	883	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	884	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	885	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	886	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And therefore thou mayst think my havior light.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	887	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	888	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Than those that have more coying to be strange.
Romeo and Juliet	2	2	889	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	I should have been more strange, I must confess,

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1005	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	The Earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb;
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1006	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	What is her burying grave, that is her womb;

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1011	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1012	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1023	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1025	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will;
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1026	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	And where the worser is predominant,

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1032	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	So soon to bid “Good morrow” to thy bed.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1033	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1034	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1035	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1036	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1037	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1038	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Thou art uproused with some distemp’rature,

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1040	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1041	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1043	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1044	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I have forgot that name and that name’s woe.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1045	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1046	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1048	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1049	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1050	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Within thy help and holy physic lies.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1051	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo,
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1052	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	My intercession likewise steads my foe.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1053	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1054	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1056	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1057	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1058	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And all combined, save what thou must combine
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1059	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	By holy marriage. When and where and how
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1060	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1061	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1062	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	That thou consent to marry us today.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1063	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1064	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1065	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1066	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1074	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1075	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	If e’er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1076	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1079	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1080	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1081	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And bad’st me bury love.
Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1082	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Not in a grave

Romeo and Juliet	2	3	1084	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now

Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1124	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	“Pink” for flower.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1125	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Right.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1126	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1127	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1128	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1129	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits faints.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1130	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry a match.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1131	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1132	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1133	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1134	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	Nay, good goose, bite not.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1135	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1136	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	And is it not, then, well served into a sweet goose?
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1137	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	O, here’s a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1138	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	I stretch it out for that word “broad,” which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1139	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. For this driveling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1140	speech	prose	Benvolio_Rom	Stop there, stop there.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1141	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1142	speech	prose	Benvolio_Rom	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1143	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	O, thou art deceived. I would have made it short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.

Romeo and Juliet	2	4	1158	speech	prose	Romeo_Rom	I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

And, as I told you, my young lady bid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will keep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

Lord, Lord, when ’twas a little prating thing—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at home?

Romeo and Juliet	3	1	1339	speech	prose	Mercutio_Rom	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou—why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon? And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?
Romeo and Juliet	3	1	1340	speech	prose	Benvolio_Rom	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1525	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And learn me how to lose a winning match
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1526	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1527	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1528	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1529	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Think true love acted simple modesty.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1530	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in night,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1531	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1532	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1533	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browed night,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1534	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1535	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1536	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1537	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	That all the world will be in love with night
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1538	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1539	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	O, I have bought the mansion of a love
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1540	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1541	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1542	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	As is the night before some festival
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1543	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	To an impatient child that hath new robes

Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1547	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1548	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.—
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1549	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The cords
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1550	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1551	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Ay, ay, the cords.

Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1553	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1554	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Ah weraday, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1555	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	We are undone, lady, we are undone.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1556	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1557	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Can heaven be so envious?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1558	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Romeo can,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1559	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1560	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Whoever would have thought it? Romeo!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1561	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1562	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	This torture should be roared in dismal hell.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1563	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but “Ay,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1564	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And that bare vowel “I” shall poison more
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1565	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1566	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	I am not I if there be such an “I,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1567	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer “Ay.”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1568	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	If he be slain, say “Ay,” or if not, “No.”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1569	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1570	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1571	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast—
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1572	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1573	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1574	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	All in gore blood. I swoonèd at the sight.

Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1578	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1579	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1580	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1581	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1582	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1583	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1584	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?

Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1589	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1590	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	It did, it did, alas the day, it did.

Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1592	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1593	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1594	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1595	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Despisèd substance of divinest show!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1596	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1597	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	A damnèd saint, an honorable villain.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1598	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1599	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1600	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1601	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Was ever book containing such vile matter
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1602	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1603	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	In such a gorgeous palace!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1604	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	There’s no trust,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1605	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1606	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1607	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1608	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1609	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Shame come to Romeo!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1610	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Blistered be thy tongue
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1611	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1612	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1613	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1614	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Sole monarch of the universal Earth.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1615	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1616	speech	verse	Nurse_Rom	Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1617	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1618	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1619	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1620	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1621	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1622	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1623	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1624	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1625	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1626	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1627	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1628	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1629	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	That murdered me. I would forget it fain,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1630	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	But, O, it presses to my memory
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1631	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners’ minds:
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1632	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	“Tybalt is dead and Romeo banishèd.”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1633	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1634	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1635	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Was woe enough if it had ended there;
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1636	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1637	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And needly will be ranked with other griefs,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1638	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1639	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	“Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1640	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Which modern lamentation might have moved?
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1641	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1642	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	“Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1643	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1644	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	All slain, all dead. “Romeo is banishèd.”
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1645	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
Romeo and Juliet	3	2	1646	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	In that word’s death. No words can that woe sound.

Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1675	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1676	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	That I yet know not?
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1677	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Too familiar

Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1679	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1680	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1681	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	A gentler judgment vanished from his lips:
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1682	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1683	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say “death,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1684	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	For exile hath more terror in his look,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1685	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Much more than death. Do not say “banishment.”
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1686	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Here from Verona art thou banishèd.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1687	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1688	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	There is no world without Verona walls
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1689	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1690	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Hence “banishèd” is “banished from the world,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1691	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And world’s exile is death. Then “banishèd”
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1692	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Is death mistermed. Calling death “banishèd,”
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1693	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1694	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1695	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1696	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1697	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1698	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	And turned that black word “death” to “banishment.”
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1699	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1700	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1701	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1702	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1703	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Live here in heaven and may look on her,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1704	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	But Romeo may not. More validity,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1705	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	More honorable state, more courtship lives
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1706	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1707	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1708	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1709	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Who even in pure and vestal modesty
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1710	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1711	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	But Romeo may not; he is banishèd.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1712	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1713	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	They are free men, but I am banishèd.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1714	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1715	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1716	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1717	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	But “banishèd” to kill me? “Banishèd”?
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1718	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	O friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1719	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1720	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,

Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1723	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1724	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1725	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1726	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1727	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	To comfort thee, though thou art banishèd.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1728	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Yet “banishèd”? Hang up philosophy.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1729	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1730	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1731	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1732	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1733	speech	verse	Romeo_Rom	How should they when that wise men have no eyes?
Romeo and Juliet	3	3	1734	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

Romeo and Juliet	3	5	1995	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	God pardon him. I do with all my heart,
Romeo and Juliet	3	5	1996	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
Romeo and Juliet	3	5	1997	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	That is because the traitor murderer lives.
Romeo and Juliet	3	5	1998	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Romeo and Juliet	3	5	1999	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!
Romeo and Juliet	3	5	2000	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Romeo and Juliet	3	5	2001	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,

Romeo and Juliet	3	5	2014	speech	verse	Juliet_Rom	To wreak the love I bore my cousin

Romeo and Juliet	3	5	2023	speech	verse	LadyCapulet_Rom	That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.

Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3012	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3013	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3014	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3015	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3016	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Betrothed and would have married her perforce
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3017	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3018	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3019	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	To rid her from this second marriage,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3020	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3021	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3022	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	A sleeping potion, which so took effect
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3023	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	As I intended, for it wrought on her
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3024	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3025	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	That he should hither come as this dire night
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3026	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3027	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3028	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3029	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3030	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Returned my letter back. Then all alone
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3031	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	At the prefixèd hour of her waking
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3032	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3033	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3034	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3035	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	But when I came, some minute ere the time
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3036	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Of her awakening, here untimely lay
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3037	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3038	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3039	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	And bear this work of heaven with patience.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3040	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3041	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	And she, too desperate, would not go with me
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3042	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3043	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	All this I know, and to the marriage
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3044	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3045	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3046	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Be sacrificed some hour before his time
Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3047	speech	verse	FriarLawrence_Rom	Unto the rigor of severest law.

Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3064	speech	verse	SERVANTS.PARIS.1_Rom	And then I ran away to call the watch.

Romeo and Juliet	5	3	3069	speech	verse	PrinceEscalus_Rom	Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.
