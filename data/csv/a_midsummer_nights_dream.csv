A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	41	speech	#Egeus_MND	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	42	speech	#Egeus_MND	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	43	speech	#Egeus_MND	As she is mine, I may dispose of her,

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	55	speech	#Theseus_MND	In himself he is,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	56	speech	#Theseus_MND	But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	57	speech	#Theseus_MND	The other must be held the worthier.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	58	speech	#Hermia_MND	I would my father looked but with my eyes.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	59	speech	#Theseus_MND	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	60	speech	#Hermia_MND	I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	61	speech	#Hermia_MND	I know not by what power I am made bold,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	62	speech	#Hermia_MND	Nor how it may concern my modesty
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	63	speech	#Hermia_MND	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	64	speech	#Hermia_MND	But I beseech your Grace that I may know
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	65	speech	#Hermia_MND	The worst that may befall me in this case
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	66	speech	#Hermia_MND	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	70	speech	#Theseus_MND	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	71	speech	#Theseus_MND	Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice)
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	72	speech	#Theseus_MND	You can endure the livery of a nun,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	73	speech	#Theseus_MND	For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	74	speech	#Theseus_MND	To live a barren sister all your life,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	75	speech	#Theseus_MND	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	76	speech	#Theseus_MND	Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	77	speech	#Theseus_MND	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	78	speech	#Theseus_MND	But earthlier happy is the rose distilled
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	79	speech	#Theseus_MND	Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	80	speech	#Theseus_MND	Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	81	speech	#Hermia_MND	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	82	speech	#Hermia_MND	Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	83	speech	#Hermia_MND	Unto his Lordship whose unwishèd yoke
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	84	speech	#Hermia_MND	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	85	speech	#Theseus_MND	Take time to pause, and by the next new moon
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	86	speech	#Theseus_MND	(The sealing day betwixt my love and me
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	87	speech	#Theseus_MND	For everlasting bond of fellowship),
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	88	speech	#Theseus_MND	Upon that day either prepare to die
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	89	speech	#Theseus_MND	For disobedience to your father’s will,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	90	speech	#Theseus_MND	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	91	speech	#Theseus_MND	Or on Diana’s altar to protest
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	92	speech	#Theseus_MND	For aye austerity and single life.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	93	speech	#Demetrius_MND	Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	94	speech	#Demetrius_MND	Thy crazèd title to my certain right.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	95	speech	#Lysander_MND	You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	96	speech	#Lysander_MND	Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	97	speech	#Egeus_MND	Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	98	speech	#Egeus_MND	And what is mine my love shall render him.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	99	speech	#Egeus_MND	And she is mine, and all my right of her

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	101	speech	#Lysander_MND	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	102	speech	#Lysander_MND	As well possessed. My love is more than his;
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	103	speech	#Lysander_MND	My fortunes every way as fairly ranked
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	104	speech	#Lysander_MND	(If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	105	speech	#Lysander_MND	And (which is more than all these boasts can be)
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	106	speech	#Lysander_MND	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	107	speech	#Lysander_MND	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	108	speech	#Lysander_MND	Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	109	speech	#Lysander_MND	Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	110	speech	#Lysander_MND	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	111	speech	#Lysander_MND	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	112	speech	#Lysander_MND	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	113	speech	#Theseus_MND	I must confess that I have heard so much,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	114	speech	#Theseus_MND	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	115	speech	#Theseus_MND	But, being overfull of self-affairs,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	116	speech	#Theseus_MND	My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	117	speech	#Theseus_MND	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	118	speech	#Theseus_MND	I have some private schooling for you both.—
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	119	speech	#Theseus_MND	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	120	speech	#Theseus_MND	To fit your fancies to your father’s will,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	121	speech	#Theseus_MND	Or else the law of Athens yields you up
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	122	speech	#Theseus_MND	(Which by no means we may extenuate)
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	123	speech	#Theseus_MND	To death or to a vow of single life.—
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	124	speech	#Theseus_MND	Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?—
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	125	speech	#Theseus_MND	Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	126	speech	#Theseus_MND	I must employ you in some business
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	127	speech	#Theseus_MND	Against our nuptial and confer with you
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	128	speech	#Theseus_MND	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	130	speech	#Lysander_MND	How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	131	speech	#Lysander_MND	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	132	speech	#Hermia_MND	Belike for want of rain, which I could well
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	133	speech	#Hermia_MND	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	134	speech	#Lysander_MND	Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	135	speech	#Lysander_MND	Could ever hear by tale or history,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	136	speech	#Lysander_MND	The course of true love never did run smooth.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	137	speech	#Lysander_MND	But either it was different in blood—
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	138	speech	#Hermia_MND	O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	139	speech	#Lysander_MND	Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	140	speech	#Hermia_MND	O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	141	speech	#Lysander_MND	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	142	speech	#Hermia_MND	O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	143	speech	#Lysander_MND	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	144	speech	#Lysander_MND	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	145	speech	#Lysander_MND	Making it momentany as a sound,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	146	speech	#Lysander_MND	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	147	speech	#Lysander_MND	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	148	speech	#Lysander_MND	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	149	speech	#Lysander_MND	And, ere a man hath power to say “Behold!”
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	150	speech	#Lysander_MND	The jaws of darkness do devour it up.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	151	speech	#Lysander_MND	So quick bright things come to confusion.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	152	speech	#Hermia_MND	If then true lovers have been ever crossed,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	153	speech	#Hermia_MND	It stands as an edict in destiny.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	154	speech	#Hermia_MND	Then let us teach our trial patience
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	155	speech	#Hermia_MND	Because it is a customary cross,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	156	speech	#Hermia_MND	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	157	speech	#Hermia_MND	Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	158	speech	#Lysander_MND	A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	159	speech	#Lysander_MND	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	160	speech	#Lysander_MND	Of great revenue, and she hath no child.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	161	speech	#Lysander_MND	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	164	speech	#Lysander_MND	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	165	speech	#Lysander_MND	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	166	speech	#Lysander_MND	Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	167	speech	#Lysander_MND	And in the wood a league without the town

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	169	speech	#Lysander_MND	To do observance to a morn of May),
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	170	speech	#Lysander_MND	There will I stay for thee.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	171	speech	#Hermia_MND	My good Lysander,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	172	speech	#Hermia_MND	I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	173	speech	#Hermia_MND	By his best arrow with the golden head,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	174	speech	#Hermia_MND	By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	175	speech	#Hermia_MND	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	176	speech	#Hermia_MND	And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	177	speech	#Hermia_MND	When the false Trojan under sail was seen,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	178	speech	#Hermia_MND	By all the vows that ever men have broke
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	179	speech	#Hermia_MND	(In number more than ever women spoke),
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	180	speech	#Hermia_MND	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	181	speech	#Hermia_MND	Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	185	speech	#Helena_MND	Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	186	speech	#Helena_MND	Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	187	speech	#Helena_MND	More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	188	speech	#Helena_MND	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	189	speech	#Helena_MND	Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	190	speech	#Helena_MND	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	191	speech	#Helena_MND	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	192	speech	#Helena_MND	My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	194	speech	#Helena_MND	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	198	speech	#Hermia_MND	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	199	speech	#Helena_MND	O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	201	speech	#Hermia_MND	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	202	speech	#Helena_MND	O, that my prayers could such affection move!
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	203	speech	#Hermia_MND	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	204	speech	#Helena_MND	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	205	speech	#Hermia_MND	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	206	speech	#Helena_MND	None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	208	speech	#Hermia_MND	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	1	1	209	speech	#Hermia_MND	Before the time I did Lysander see

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	2	1	157	speech	#Oberon_MND	That the rude sea grew civil at her song

A Midsummer Night’s Dream	2	1	165	speech	#Oberon_MND	And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow
A Midsummer Night’s Dream	2	1	166	speech	#Oberon_MND	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.
