A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	3	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	4	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	7	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	8	speech	verse	Hippolyta_MND	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	20	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	And won thy love doing thee injuries,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	21	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	But I will wed thee in another key,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	22	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	28	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Stand forth, Demetrius.—My noble lord,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	29	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	This man hath my consent to marry her.—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	30	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Stand forth, Lysander.—And, my gracious duke,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	31	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	32	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	33	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	And interchanged love tokens with my child.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	34	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	35	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	With feigning voice verses of feigning love
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	36	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	And stol’n the impression of her fantasy

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	38	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	40	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	41	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Turned her obedience (which is due to me)
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	42	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	43	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Be it so she will not here before your Grace
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	44	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	45	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	46	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	As she is mine, I may dispose of her,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	47	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Which shall be either to this gentleman
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	48	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Or to her death, according to our law
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	49	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Immediately provided in that case.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	50	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	51	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To you, your father should be as a god,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	52	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	53	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To whom you are but as a form in wax
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	54	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	By him imprinted, and within his power
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	55	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To leave the figure or disfigure it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	56	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	57	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	So is Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	58	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	In himself he is,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	59	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	60	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	The other must be held the worthier.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	61	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	I would my father looked but with my eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	62	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	63	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	64	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	I know not by what power I am made bold,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	65	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Nor how it may concern my modesty
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	66	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	67	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	But I beseech your Grace that I may know
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	68	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	The worst that may befall me in this case
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	69	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	70	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Either to die the death or to abjure
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	71	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Forever the society of men.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	72	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	73	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	74	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice)
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	75	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	You can endure the livery of a nun,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	76	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	77	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To live a barren sister all your life,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	78	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	79	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	80	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	81	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	But earthlier happy is the rose distilled
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	82	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	83	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	84	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	85	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	86	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Unto his Lordship whose unwishèd yoke
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	87	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	88	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Take time to pause, and by the next new moon
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	89	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	(The sealing day betwixt my love and me
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	90	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	For everlasting bond of fellowship),
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	91	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Upon that day either prepare to die
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	92	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	For disobedience to your father’s will,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	93	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	94	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Or on Diana’s altar to protest
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	95	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	For aye austerity and single life.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	96	speech	verse	Demetrius_MND	Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	97	speech	verse	Demetrius_MND	Thy crazèd title to my certain right.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	98	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	99	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	100	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	101	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	And what is mine my love shall render him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	102	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	And she is mine, and all my right of her
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	103	speech	verse	Egeus_MND	I do estate unto Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	104	direction	delivery	Lysander_MND	, to Theseus
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	105	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	106	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	As well possessed. My love is more than his;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	107	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	My fortunes every way as fairly ranked
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	108	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	(If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	109	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	And (which is more than all these boasts can be)
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	110	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	111	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	112	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	113	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	114	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	115	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	116	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	117	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	I must confess that I have heard so much,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	118	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	119	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	But, being overfull of self-affairs,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	120	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	121	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	122	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	I have some private schooling for you both.—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	123	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	124	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To fit your fancies to your father’s will,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	125	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Or else the law of Athens yields you up
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	126	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	(Which by no means we may extenuate)
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	127	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	To death or to a vow of single life.—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	128	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	129	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	130	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	I must employ you in some business
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	131	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Against our nuptial and confer with you
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	132	speech	verse	Theseus_MND	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	135	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	136	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	137	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Belike for want of rain, which I could well
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	138	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	139	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	140	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Could ever hear by tale or history,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	141	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	The course of true love never did run smooth.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	142	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	But either it was different in blood—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	143	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	144	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	145	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	146	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	147	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	148	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	149	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	150	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Making it momentany as a sound,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	151	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	152	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	153	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	154	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	And, ere a man hath power to say “Behold!”
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	155	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	The jaws of darkness do devour it up.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	156	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	So quick bright things come to confusion.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	157	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	If then true lovers have been ever crossed,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	158	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	It stands as an edict in destiny.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	159	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Then let us teach our trial patience
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	160	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Because it is a customary cross,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	161	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	162	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	163	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	164	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	165	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Of great revenue, and she hath no child.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	166	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	167	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	And she respects me as her only son.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	168	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	169	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	170	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	171	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	172	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	And in the wood a league without the town
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	173	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	(Where I did meet thee once with Helena
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	174	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	To do observance to a morn of May),
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	175	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	There will I stay for thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	176	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	My good Lysander,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	177	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	178	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	By his best arrow with the golden head,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	179	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	180	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	181	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	182	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	When the false Trojan under sail was seen,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	183	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	By all the vows that ever men have broke
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	184	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	(In number more than ever women spoke),
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	185	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	186	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	187	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	189	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	190	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Call you me “fair”? That “fair” again unsay.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	191	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	192	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	193	speech	verse	Helena_MND	More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	194	speech	verse	Helena_MND	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	195	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	196	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	197	speech	verse	Helena_MND	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	198	speech	verse	Helena_MND	My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	199	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	200	speech	verse	Helena_MND	The rest I’d give to be to you translated.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	201	speech	verse	Helena_MND	O, teach me how you look and with what art
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	202	speech	verse	Helena_MND	You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	203	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	204	speech	verse	Helena_MND	O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	205	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	206	speech	verse	Helena_MND	O, that my prayers could such affection move!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	207	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	208	speech	verse	Helena_MND	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	209	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	210	speech	verse	Helena_MND	None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	211	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	212	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	213	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Before the time I did Lysander see
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	214	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	215	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	216	speech	verse	Hermia_MND	That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	217	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	218	speech	verse	Lysander_MND	Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	244	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	245	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Love can transpose to form and dignity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	246	speech	verse	Helena_MND	Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	1	247	speech	verse	Helena_MND	And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	269	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	270	speech	prose	Quince_MND	Marry, our play is “The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.”
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	271	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	275	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	What is Pyramus—a lover or a tyrant?
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	276	speech	prose	Quince_MND	A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	277	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest.—Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split:
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	278	speech	verse	Bottom_MND	The raging rocks
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	279	speech	verse	Bottom_MND	And shivering shocks
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	280	speech	verse	Bottom_MND	Shall break the locks

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	285	speech	verse	Bottom_MND	The foolish Fates.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	286	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein. A lover is more condoling.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	288	speech	prose	Flute_MND	Here, Peter Quince.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	292	speech	prose	Flute_MND	Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	293	speech	prose	Quince_MND	That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	294	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: “Thisne, Thisne!”—“Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe dear and lady dear!”

A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	301	speech	prose	Quince_MND	You, Pyramus’ father.—Myself, Thisbe’s father.—Snug the joiner, you the lion’s part.— And I hope here is a play fitted.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	302	speech	prose	Snug_MND	Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	303	speech	prose	Quince_MND	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	304	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say “Let him roar again. Let him roar again!”
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	305	speech	prose	Quince_MND	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies that they would shriek, and that were enough to hang us all.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	306	speech	prose	Quince_MND,Bottom_MND,Flute_MND,Snout_MND,Snug_MND,Starveling_MND	That would hang us, every mother’s son.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	307	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove. I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	308	speech	prose	Quince_MND	You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely gentlemanlike man. Therefore you must needs play  Pyramus.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	309	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	310	speech	prose	Quince_MND	Why, what you will.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	311	speech	prose	Bottom_MND	I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-color beard, your perfit yellow.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	2	312	speech	prose	Quince_MND	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play barefaced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.

The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.

Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man look o’er his part. For the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more words. Away! Go, away!
