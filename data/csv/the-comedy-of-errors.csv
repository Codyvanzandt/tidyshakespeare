The Comedy of Errors	1	1	2	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	3	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And by the doom of death end woes and all.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	4	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	5	speech	verse	Duke_Err	I am not partial to infringe our laws.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	6	speech	verse	Duke_Err	The enmity and discord which of late
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	7	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	8	speech	verse	Duke_Err	To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	9	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	10	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Have sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	11	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	12	speech	verse	Duke_Err	For since the mortal and intestine jars
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	13	speech	verse	Duke_Err	’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	14	speech	verse	Duke_Err	It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	15	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	16	speech	verse	Duke_Err	To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	17	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	18	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	19	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Again, if any Syracusian born
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	20	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	21	speech	verse	Duke_Err	His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	22	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Unless a thousand marks be levièd
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	23	speech	verse	Duke_Err	To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	24	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	25	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	26	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	27	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	28	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	29	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	30	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Why thou departedst from thy native home
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	31	speech	verse	Duke_Err	And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	32	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	A heavier task could not have been imposed
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	33	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	34	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Yet, that the world may witness that my end
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	35	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	36	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	37	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	In Syracusa was I born, and wed
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	38	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Unto a woman happy but for me,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	39	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And by me, had not our hap been bad.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	40	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	41	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	By prosperous voyages I often made
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	42	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	To Epidamium, till my factor’s death
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	43	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And the great care of goods at random left
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	44	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	45	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	From whom my absence was not six months old
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	46	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Before herself—almost at fainting under
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	47	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	The pleasing punishment that women bear—
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	48	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Had made provision for her following me
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	49	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And soon and safe arrivèd where I was.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	50	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	There had she not been long but she became
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	51	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	A joyful mother of two goodly sons,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	52	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And, which was strange, the one so like the other
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	53	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	As could not be distinguished but by names.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	54	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	That very hour, and in the selfsame inn,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	55	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	A mean woman was deliverèd
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	56	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	57	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	58	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	59	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	60	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Made daily motions for our home return.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	61	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	62	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	We came aboard.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	63	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	A league from Epidamium had we sailed
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	64	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Before the always-wind-obeying deep
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	65	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Gave any tragic instance of our harm;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	66	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	But longer did we not retain much hope,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	67	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	For what obscurèd light the heavens did grant
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	68	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Did but convey unto our fearful minds
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	69	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	A doubtful warrant of immediate death,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	70	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	71	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	72	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Weeping before for what she saw must come,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	73	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	74	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	75	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	76	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And this it was, for other means was none:
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	77	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	The sailors sought for safety by our boat
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	78	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	79	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	80	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	81	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Such as seafaring men provide for storms.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	82	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	To him one of the other twins was bound,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	83	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	84	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	85	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	86	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Fastened ourselves at either end the mast
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	87	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	88	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	89	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	90	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Dispersed those vapors that offended us,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	91	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And by the benefit of his wished light
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	92	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	The seas waxed calm, and we discoverèd
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	93	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Two ships from far, making amain to us,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	94	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	95	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	But ere they came—O, let me say no more!
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	96	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Gather the sequel by that went before.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	97	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Nay, forward, old man. Do not break off so,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	98	speech	verse	Duke_Err	For we may pity though not pardon thee.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	99	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	O, had the gods done so, I had not now
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	100	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Worthily termed them merciless to us.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	101	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	102	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	We were encountered by a mighty rock,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	103	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Which being violently borne upon,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	104	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	105	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	106	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Fortune had left to both of us alike
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	107	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	108	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdenèd
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	109	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	110	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Was carried with more speed before the wind,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	111	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And in our sight they three were taken up
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	112	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	113	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	At length, another ship had seized on us
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	114	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	115	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	116	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And would have reft the fishers of their prey
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	117	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	118	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	119	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	120	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	That by misfortunes was my life prolonged
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	121	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	122	speech	verse	Duke_Err	And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	123	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Do me the favor to dilate at full
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	124	speech	verse	Duke_Err	What have befall’n of them and thee till now.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	125	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	126	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	At eighteen years became inquisitive
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	127	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	After his brother, and importuned me
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	128	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	That his attendant—so his case was like,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	129	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Reft of his brother, but retained his name—
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	130	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Might bear him company in the quest of him,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	131	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	132	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	133	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	134	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	135	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	136	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	137	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Or that or any place that harbors men.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	138	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	But here must end the story of my life;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	139	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	And happy were I in my timely death
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	140	speech	verse	Egeon_Err	Could all my travels warrant me they live.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	141	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have marked
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	142	speech	verse	Duke_Err	To bear the extremity of dire mishap,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	143	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	144	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	145	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	146	speech	verse	Duke_Err	My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	147	speech	verse	Duke_Err	But though thou art adjudgèd to the death,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	148	speech	verse	Duke_Err	And passèd sentence may not be recalled
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	149	speech	verse	Duke_Err	But to our honor’s great disparagement,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	150	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Yet will I favor thee in what I can.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	151	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	152	speech	verse	Duke_Err	To seek thy life by beneficial help.
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	153	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	154	speech	verse	Duke_Err	Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
The Comedy of Errors	1	1	155	speech	verse	Duke_Err	And live. If no, then thou art doomed to die.—

The Comedy of Errors	2	1	383	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	I see the jewel best enamelèd

The Comedy of Errors	2	2	444	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	445	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	446	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Your reason?
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	447	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	448	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Well, sir, learn to jest in good time. There’s a time for all things.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	449	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	450	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	By what rule, sir?
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	451	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	452	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Let’s hear it.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	453	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	454	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	May he not do it by fine and recovery?
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	455	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	456	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	457	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	458	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	459	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	460	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	461	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	462	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	For what reason?
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	463	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	For two, and sound ones too.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	464	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Nay, not sound, I pray you.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	465	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Sure ones, then.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	466	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	467	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Certain ones, then.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	468	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Name them.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	469	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	470	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	471	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Marry, and did, sir: namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	472	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	473	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore, to the world’s end, will have bald followers.
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	474	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?

The Comedy of Errors	2	2	496	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	497	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	498	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	And that this body, consecrate to thee,
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	499	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	500	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,

The Comedy of Errors	2	2	506	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	I am possessed with an adulterate blot;
The Comedy of Errors	2	2	507	speech	verse	Adriana_Err	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;

The Comedy of Errors	3	2	829	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would have me as a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me, but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	830	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	What is she?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	831	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	A very reverend body, ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say “sir-reverence.” I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.

I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	834	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	What complexion is she of?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	835	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept. For why? She sweats. A man may go overshoes in the grime of it.

The Comedy of Errors	3	2	837	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	838	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	What’s her name?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	839	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Nell, sir, but her name and three quarters—that’s an ell and three quarters— will not measure her from hip to hip.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	840	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Then she bears some breadth?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	841	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip. She is spherical, like a globe. I could find out countries in her.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	842	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	In what part of her body stands Ireland?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	843	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Marry, sir, in her buttocks. I found it out by the bogs.

The Comedy of Errors	3	2	849	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them. But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	850	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Where Spain?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	851	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her breath.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	852	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Where America, the Indies?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	853	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	O, sir, upon her nose, all o’erembellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadas of carracks to be ballast at her nose.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	854	speech	prose	AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	855	speech	prose	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	O, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me, called me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch.
The Comedy of Errors	3	2	856	speech	verse	DromioOfSyracuse_Err	And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel,
