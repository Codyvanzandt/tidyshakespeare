Twelfth Night	1	1	3	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	If music be the food of love, play on.
Twelfth Night	1	1	4	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
Twelfth Night	1	1	5	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	The appetite may sicken and so die.
Twelfth Night	1	1	6	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That strain again! It had a dying fall.
Twelfth Night	1	1	7	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound
Twelfth Night	1	1	8	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Twelfth Night	1	1	9	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Stealing and giving odor. Enough; no more.
Twelfth Night	1	1	10	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
Twelfth Night	1	1	11	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,
Twelfth Night	1	1	12	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Twelfth Night	1	1	13	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,
Twelfth Night	1	1	14	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Of what validity and pitch soe’er,
Twelfth Night	1	1	15	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	But falls into abatement and low price
Twelfth Night	1	1	16	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy
Twelfth Night	1	1	17	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That it alone is high fantastical.
Twelfth Night	1	1	18	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Curio_TN	Will you go hunt, my lord?
Twelfth Night	1	1	19	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	What, Curio?
Twelfth Night	1	1	20	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Curio_TN	The hart.
Twelfth Night	1	1	21	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
Twelfth Night	1	1	22	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
Twelfth Night	1	1	23	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Methought she purged the air of pestilence.
Twelfth Night	1	1	24	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That instant was I turned into a hart,
Twelfth Night	1	1	25	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
Twelfth Night	1	1	26	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	E’er since pursue me.

Twelfth Night	1	1	29	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
Twelfth Night	1	1	30	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	But from her handmaid do return this answer:
Twelfth Night	1	1	31	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	The element itself, till seven years’ heat,
Twelfth Night	1	1	32	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	Shall not behold her face at ample view,
Twelfth Night	1	1	33	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	But like a cloistress she will veilèd walk,
Twelfth Night	1	1	34	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	And water once a day her chamber round
Twelfth Night	1	1	35	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	With eye-offending brine—all this to season
Twelfth Night	1	1	36	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh
Twelfth Night	1	1	37	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.ORSINO.Valentine_TN	And lasting in her sad remembrance.
Twelfth Night	1	1	38	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
Twelfth Night	1	1	39	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
Twelfth Night	1	1	40	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	How will she love when the rich golden shaft
Twelfth Night	1	1	41	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Hath killed the flock of all affections else
Twelfth Night	1	1	42	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
Twelfth Night	1	1	43	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled

Twelfth Night	1	2	50	speech	verse	Captain_TN	This is Illyria, lady.
Twelfth Night	1	2	51	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And what should I do in Illyria?
Twelfth Night	1	2	52	speech	verse	Viola_TN	My brother he is in Elysium.
Twelfth Night	1	2	53	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Perchance he is not drowned.—What think you, sailors?
Twelfth Night	1	2	54	speech	verse	Captain_TN	It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
Twelfth Night	1	2	55	speech	verse	Viola_TN	O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.
Twelfth Night	1	2	56	speech	verse	Captain_TN	True, madam. And to comfort you with chance,
Twelfth Night	1	2	57	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
Twelfth Night	1	2	58	speech	verse	Captain_TN	When you and those poor number saved with you
Twelfth Night	1	2	59	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Twelfth Night	1	2	60	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Most provident in peril, bind himself
Twelfth Night	1	2	61	speech	verse	Captain_TN	(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)
Twelfth Night	1	2	62	speech	verse	Captain_TN	To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,
Twelfth Night	1	2	63	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,
Twelfth Night	1	2	64	speech	verse	Captain_TN	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves

Twelfth Night	1	2	67	speech	verse	Viola_TN	For saying so, there’s gold.
Twelfth Night	1	2	68	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
Twelfth Night	1	2	69	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
Twelfth Night	1	2	70	speech	verse	Viola_TN	The like of him. Know’st thou this country?
Twelfth Night	1	2	71	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born
Twelfth Night	1	2	72	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Not three hours’ travel from this very place.
Twelfth Night	1	2	73	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Who governs here?
Twelfth Night	1	2	74	speech	verse	Captain_TN	A noble duke, in nature as in name.
Twelfth Night	1	2	75	speech	verse	Viola_TN	What is his name?
Twelfth Night	1	2	76	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Orsino.
Twelfth Night	1	2	77	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Orsino. I have heard my father name him.
Twelfth Night	1	2	78	speech	verse	Viola_TN	He was a bachelor then.
Twelfth Night	1	2	79	speech	verse	Captain_TN	And so is now, or was so very late;
Twelfth Night	1	2	80	speech	verse	Captain_TN	For but a month ago I went from hence,
Twelfth Night	1	2	81	speech	verse	Captain_TN	And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as, you know,
Twelfth Night	1	2	82	speech	verse	Captain_TN	What great ones do the less will prattle of)
Twelfth Night	1	2	83	speech	verse	Captain_TN	That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
Twelfth Night	1	2	84	speech	verse	Viola_TN	What’s she?
Twelfth Night	1	2	85	speech	verse	Captain_TN	A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
Twelfth Night	1	2	86	speech	verse	Captain_TN	That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
Twelfth Night	1	2	87	speech	verse	Captain_TN	In the protection of his son, her brother,
Twelfth Night	1	2	88	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,
Twelfth Night	1	2	89	speech	verse	Captain_TN	They say, she hath abjured the sight
Twelfth Night	1	2	90	speech	verse	Captain_TN	And company of men.
Twelfth Night	1	2	91	speech	verse	Viola_TN	O, that I served that lady,
Twelfth Night	1	2	92	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And might not be delivered to the world
Twelfth Night	1	2	93	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
Twelfth Night	1	2	94	speech	verse	Viola_TN	What my estate is.
Twelfth Night	1	2	95	speech	verse	Captain_TN	That were hard to compass
Twelfth Night	1	2	96	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Because she will admit no kind of suit,
Twelfth Night	1	2	97	speech	verse	Captain_TN	No, not the Duke’s.
Twelfth Night	1	2	98	speech	verse	Viola_TN	There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,
Twelfth Night	1	2	99	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Twelfth Night	1	2	100	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
Twelfth Night	1	2	101	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
Twelfth Night	1	2	102	speech	verse	Viola_TN	With this thy fair and outward character.
Twelfth Night	1	2	103	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously—
Twelfth Night	1	2	104	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
Twelfth Night	1	2	105	speech	verse	Viola_TN	For such disguise as haply shall become
Twelfth Night	1	2	106	speech	verse	Viola_TN	The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke.
Twelfth Night	1	2	107	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.
Twelfth Night	1	2	108	speech	verse	Viola_TN	It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing
Twelfth Night	1	2	109	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And speak to him in many sorts of music
Twelfth Night	1	2	110	speech	verse	Viola_TN	That will allow me very worth his service.
Twelfth Night	1	2	111	speech	verse	Viola_TN	What else may hap, to time I will commit.
Twelfth Night	1	2	112	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Twelfth Night	1	2	113	speech	verse	Captain_TN	Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.
Twelfth Night	1	2	114	speech	verse	Captain_TN	When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
Twelfth Night	1	2	115	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I thank thee. Lead me on.

Twelfth Night	1	3	117	direction	entrance	TobyBelch_TN	Enter Sir Toby and Maria.
Twelfth Night	1	3	117	direction	entrance	Maria_TN	Enter Sir Toby and Maria.
Twelfth Night	1	3	118	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.
Twelfth Night	1	3	119	speech	prose	Maria_TN	By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
Twelfth Night	1	3	120	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Why, let her except before excepted!
Twelfth Night	1	3	121	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.
Twelfth Night	1	3	122	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps!
Twelfth Night	1	3	123	speech	prose	Maria_TN	That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
Twelfth Night	1	3	124	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
Twelfth Night	1	3	125	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Ay, he.
Twelfth Night	1	3	126	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria.
Twelfth Night	1	3	127	speech	prose	Maria_TN	What’s that to th’ purpose?
Twelfth Night	1	3	128	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Why, he has three thousand ducats a year!
Twelfth Night	1	3	129	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool and a prodigal.
Twelfth Night	1	3	130	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Fie that you’ll say so! He plays o’ th’ viol-de-gamboys and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.
Twelfth Night	1	3	131	speech	prose	Maria_TN	He hath indeed, almost natural, for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler, and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
Twelfth Night	1	3	132	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they?
Twelfth Night	1	3	133	speech	prose	Maria_TN	They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.
Twelfth Night	1	3	134	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’ toe like a parish top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo, for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
Twelfth Night	1	3	135	direction	entrance	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Enter Sir Andrew.
Twelfth Night	1	3	136	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?
Twelfth Night	1	3	137	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Sweet Sir Andrew!
Twelfth Night	1	3	138	direction	delivery	AndrewAguecheek_TN	, to Maria
Twelfth Night	1	3	139	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Bless you, fair shrew.
Twelfth Night	1	3	140	speech	prose	Maria_TN	And you too, sir.
Twelfth Night	1	3	141	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Accost, Sir Andrew, accost!
Twelfth Night	1	3	142	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	What’s that?
Twelfth Night	1	3	143	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	My niece’s chambermaid.
Twelfth Night	1	3	144	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
Twelfth Night	1	3	145	speech	prose	Maria_TN	My name is Mary, sir.
Twelfth Night	1	3	146	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Good Mistress Mary Accost—
Twelfth Night	1	3	147	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.
Twelfth Night	1	3	148	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of “accost”?
Twelfth Night	1	3	149	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Fare you well, gentlemen.
Twelfth Night	1	3	150	direction	business	Maria_TN	She begins to exit.
Twelfth Night	1	3	151	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
Twelfth Night	1	3	152	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
Twelfth Night	1	3	153	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Sir, I have not you by th’ hand.
Twelfth Night	1	3	154	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.
Twelfth Night	1	3	155	direction	business	AndrewAguecheek_TN	He offers his hand.
Twelfth Night	1	3	156	direction	business	Maria_TN	, taking his hand
Twelfth Night	1	3	156	direction	business	AndrewAguecheek_TN	, taking his hand
Twelfth Night	1	3	157	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Now sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th’ butt’ry bar and let it drink.
Twelfth Night	1	3	158	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?
Twelfth Night	1	3	159	speech	prose	Maria_TN	It’s dry, sir.
Twelfth Night	1	3	160	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?
Twelfth Night	1	3	161	speech	prose	Maria_TN	A dry jest, sir.
Twelfth Night	1	3	162	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Are you full of them?
Twelfth Night	1	3	163	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.
Twelfth Night	1	3	164	direction	exit	Maria_TN	Maria exits.
Twelfth Night	1	3	165	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary! When did I see thee so put down?
Twelfth Night	1	3	166	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.
Twelfth Night	1	3	167	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	No question.
Twelfth Night	1	3	168	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	An I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Twelfth Night	1	3	169	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Pourquoi, my dear knight?
Twelfth Night	1	3	170	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	What is “pourquoi”? Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bearbaiting. O, had I but followed the arts!
Twelfth Night	1	3	171	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Twelfth Night	1	3	172	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Why, would that have mended my hair?
Twelfth Night	1	3	173	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
Twelfth Night	1	3	174	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?
Twelfth Night	1	3	175	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Excellent! It hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
Twelfth Night	1	3	176	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by woos her.
Twelfth Night	1	3	177	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	She’ll none o’ th’ Count. She’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have heard her swear ’t. Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.
Twelfth Night	1	3	178	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’ strangest mind i’ th’ world. I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
Twelfth Night	1	3	179	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
Twelfth Night	1	3	180	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare with an old man.
Twelfth Night	1	3	181	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
Twelfth Night	1	3	182	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Faith, I can cut a caper.
Twelfth Night	1	3	183	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	And I can cut the mutton to ’t.
Twelfth Night	1	3	184	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.
Twelfth Night	1	3	185	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
Twelfth Night	1	3	186	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some revels?
Twelfth Night	1	3	187	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?
Twelfth Night	1	3	188	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Taurus? That’s sides and heart.
Twelfth Night	1	3	189	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!

Twelfth Night	1	4	194	speech	prose	Viola_TN	You either fear his humor or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favors?

Twelfth Night	1	4	202	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Stand you awhile aloof.—Cesario,
Twelfth Night	1	4	203	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclasped
Twelfth Night	1	4	204	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	To thee the book even of my secret soul.
Twelfth Night	1	4	205	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her.
Twelfth Night	1	4	206	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Be not denied access. Stand at her doors

Twelfth Night	1	4	210	speech	verse	Viola_TN	If she be so abandoned to her sorrow
Twelfth Night	1	4	211	speech	verse	Viola_TN	As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
Twelfth Night	1	4	212	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
Twelfth Night	1	4	213	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Rather than make unprofited return.
Twelfth Night	1	4	214	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
Twelfth Night	1	4	215	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	O, then unfold the passion of my love.

Twelfth Night	1	4	217	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	It shall become thee well to act my woes.
Twelfth Night	1	4	218	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	She will attend it better in thy youth
Twelfth Night	1	4	219	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
Twelfth Night	1	4	220	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I think not so, my lord.
Twelfth Night	1	4	221	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Dear lad, believe it;
Twelfth Night	1	4	222	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	For they shall yet belie thy happy years
Twelfth Night	1	4	223	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	That say thou art a man. Diana’s lip
Twelfth Night	1	4	224	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe
Twelfth Night	1	4	225	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,
Twelfth Night	1	4	226	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	And all is semblative a womans part.
Twelfth Night	1	4	227	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	I know thy constellation is right apt
Twelfth Night	1	4	228	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	For this affair.—Some four or five attend him,
Twelfth Night	1	4	229	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	All, if you will, for I myself am best
Twelfth Night	1	4	230	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	When least in company.—Prosper well in this
Twelfth Night	1	4	231	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
Twelfth Night	1	4	232	speech	verse	Orsino_TN	To call his fortunes thine.
Twelfth Night	1	4	233	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I’ll do my best

Twelfth Night	1	5	239	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Twelfth Night	1	5	240	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors.
Twelfth Night	1	5	241	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Make that good.
Twelfth Night	1	5	242	speech	prose	Feste_TN	He shall see none to fear.
Twelfth Night	1	5	243	speech	prose	Maria_TN	A good Lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”
Twelfth Night	1	5	244	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Where, good Mistress Mary?
Twelfth Night	1	5	245	speech	prose	Maria_TN	In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Twelfth Night	1	5	246	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and those that are Fools, let them use their talents.
Twelfth Night	1	5	247	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent. Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
Twelfth Night	1	5	248	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.
Twelfth Night	1	5	249	speech	prose	Maria_TN	You are resolute, then?
Twelfth Night	1	5	250	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.
Twelfth Night	1	5	251	speech	prose	Maria_TN	That if one break, the other will hold, or if both break, your gaskins fall.
Twelfth Night	1	5	252	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.
Twelfth Night	1	5	253	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Peace, you rogue. No more o’ that. Here comes my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best.

Twelfth Night	1	5	256	direction	delivery	Feste_TN	, aside
Twelfth Night	1	5	257	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? “Better a witty Fool than a foolish wit.”—God bless thee, lady!
Twelfth Night	1	5	258	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Take the Fool away.
Twelfth Night	1	5	259	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the Lady.
Twelfth Night	1	5	260	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Go to, you’re a dry Fool. I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.
Twelfth Night	1	5	261	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend. For give the dry Fool drink, then is the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say again, take her away.
Twelfth Night	1	5	262	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Sir, I bade them take away you.
Twelfth Night	1	5	263	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit monachum. That’s as much to say as, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.
Twelfth Night	1	5	264	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Can you do it?
Twelfth Night	1	5	265	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Dexteriously, good madonna.
Twelfth Night	1	5	266	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Make your proof.
Twelfth Night	1	5	267	speech	prose	Feste_TN	I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
Twelfth Night	1	5	268	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof.
Twelfth Night	1	5	269	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Good madonna, why mourn’st thou?
Twelfth Night	1	5	270	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Good Fool, for my brother’s death.
Twelfth Night	1	5	271	speech	prose	Feste_TN	I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
Twelfth Night	1	5	272	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.
Twelfth Night	1	5	273	speech	prose	Feste_TN	The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
Twelfth Night	1	5	274	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?
Twelfth Night	1	5	275	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better Fool.
Twelfth Night	1	5	276	speech	prose	Feste_TN	God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.
Twelfth Night	1	5	277	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	How say you to that, Malvolio?
Twelfth Night	1	5	278	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than the Fools’ zanies.
Twelfth Night	1	5	279	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed Fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.
Twelfth Night	1	5	280	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak’st well of Fools!

Twelfth Night	1	5	283	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	From the Count Orsino, is it?
Twelfth Night	1	5	284	speech	prose	Maria_TN	I know not, madam. ’Tis a fair young man, and well attended.
Twelfth Night	1	5	285	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Who of my people hold him in delay?
Twelfth Night	1	5	286	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
Twelfth Night	1	5	287	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him! Go you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.

Twelfth Night	1	5	290	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.
Twelfth Night	1	5	291	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a Fool, whose skull Jove cram with brains, for—here he comes—one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.
Twelfth Night	1	5	292	direction	entrance	TobyBelch_TN	Enter Sir Toby.
Twelfth Night	1	5	293	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	By mine honor, half drunk!—What is he at the gate, cousin?
Twelfth Night	1	5	294	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	A gentleman.
Twelfth Night	1	5	295	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	A gentleman? What gentleman?
Twelfth Night	1	5	296	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	’Tis a gentleman here—a plague o’ these pickle herring!—How now, sot?
Twelfth Night	1	5	297	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Good Sir Toby.
Twelfth Night	1	5	298	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
Twelfth Night	1	5	299	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Lechery? I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.
Twelfth Night	1	5	300	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Ay, marry, what is he?
Twelfth Night	1	5	301	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Let him be the devil an he will, I care not. Give me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one.

Twelfth Night	1	5	303	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	What’s a drunken man like, Fool?
Twelfth Night	1	5	304	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman. One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.
Twelfth Night	1	5	305	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o’ my coz, for he’s in the third degree of drink: he’s drowned. Go look after him.
Twelfth Night	1	5	306	speech	prose	Feste_TN	He is but mad yet, madonna, and the Fool shall look to the madman.

Twelfth Night	1	5	309	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial.
Twelfth Night	1	5	310	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Tell him he shall not speak with me.
Twelfth Night	1	5	311	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	Has been told so, and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post and be the supporter to a bench, but he’ll speak with you.
Twelfth Night	1	5	312	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	What kind o’ man is he?
Twelfth Night	1	5	313	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	Why, of mankind.
Twelfth Night	1	5	314	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	What manner of man?
Twelfth Night	1	5	315	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you, will you or no.
Twelfth Night	1	5	316	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Of what personage and years is he?
Twelfth Night	1	5	317	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy—as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.
Twelfth Night	1	5	318	speech	verse	Olivia_TN	Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.

Twelfth Night	1	5	327	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?
Twelfth Night	1	5	328	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech, for, besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible even to the least sinister usage.
Twelfth Night	1	5	329	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Whence came you, sir?
Twelfth Night	1	5	330	speech	prose	Viola_TN	I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.
Twelfth Night	1	5	331	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Are you a comedian?
Twelfth Night	1	5	332	speech	prose	Viola_TN	No, my profound heart. And yet by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?
Twelfth Night	1	5	333	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	If I do not usurp myself, I am.
Twelfth Night	1	5	334	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message.
Twelfth Night	1	5	335	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Come to what is important in ’t. I forgive you the praise.
Twelfth Night	1	5	336	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.
Twelfth Night	1	5	337	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, begone; if you have reason, be brief. ’Tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
Twelfth Night	1	5	338	speech	prose	Maria_TN	Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
Twelfth Night	1	5	339	speech	prose	Viola_TN	No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer.—Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
Twelfth Night	1	5	340	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Tell me your mind.
Twelfth Night	1	5	341	speech	prose	Viola_TN	I am a messenger.
Twelfth Night	1	5	342	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
Twelfth Night	1	5	343	speech	prose	Viola_TN	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.
Twelfth Night	1	5	344	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?
Twelfth Night	1	5	345	speech	prose	Viola_TN	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.
Twelfth Night	1	5	346	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Give us the place alone. We will hear this divinity. Now, sir, what is your text?

Twelfth Night	1	5	349	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?
Twelfth Night	1	5	350	speech	prose	Viola_TN	In Orsino’s bosom.
Twelfth Night	1	5	351	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?
Twelfth Night	1	5	352	speech	prose	Viola_TN	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
Twelfth Night	1	5	353	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
Twelfth Night	1	5	354	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Good madam, let me see your face.
Twelfth Night	1	5	355	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is ’t not well done?
Twelfth Night	1	5	356	direction	business	Olivia_TN	She removes her veil.
Twelfth Night	1	5	357	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Excellently done, if God did all.
Twelfth Night	1	5	358	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and weather.
Twelfth Night	1	5	359	speech	verse	Viola_TN	’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
Twelfth Night	1	5	360	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.
Twelfth Night	1	5	361	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Lady, you are the cruel’st she alive
Twelfth Night	1	5	362	speech	verse	Viola_TN	If you will lead these graces to the grave
Twelfth Night	1	5	363	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And leave the world no copy.
Twelfth Night	1	5	364	speech	prose	Olivia_TN	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted! I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two gray eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?
Twelfth Night	1	5	365	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I see you what you are. You are too proud.
Twelfth Night	1	5	366	speech	verse	Viola_TN	But if you were the devil you are fair.
Twelfth Night	1	5	367	speech	verse	Viola_TN	My lord and master loves you. O, such love
Twelfth Night	1	5	368	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Could be but recompensed though you were crowned

Twelfth Night	1	5	371	speech	verse	Viola_TN	With adorations, fertile tears,
Twelfth Night	1	5	372	speech	verse	Viola_TN	With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
Twelfth Night	1	5	373	speech	verse	Olivia_TN	Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.

Twelfth Night	1	5	383	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I would not understand it.

Twelfth Night	1	5	424	speech	verse	Olivia_TN	The County’s man. He left this ring behind him,

Twelfth Night	2	1	439	speech	prose	Antonio_TN	Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you?
Twelfth Night	2	1	440	speech	prose	Sebastian_TN	By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
Twelfth Night	2	1	441	speech	prose	Antonio_TN	Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
Twelfth Night	2	1	442	speech	prose	Sebastian_TN	No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me, then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
Twelfth Night	2	1	443	speech	prose	Antonio_TN	Alas the day!
Twelfth Night	2	1	444	speech	prose	Sebastian_TN	A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
Twelfth Night	2	1	445	speech	prose	Antonio_TN	Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
Twelfth Night	2	1	446	speech	prose	Sebastian_TN	O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
Twelfth Night	2	1	447	speech	prose	Antonio_TN	If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.
Twelfth Night	2	1	448	speech	prose	Sebastian_TN	If you will not undo what you have done— that is, kill him whom you have recovered—desire it not. Fare you well at once. My bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court. Farewell.

Twelfth Night	2	2	459	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.
Twelfth Night	2	2	460	speech	prose	Viola_TN	She took the ring of me. I’ll none of it.

Twelfth Night	2	2	468	speech	verse	Viola_TN	She made good view of me, indeed so much
Twelfth Night	2	2	469	speech	verse	Viola_TN	That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
Twelfth Night	2	2	470	speech	verse	Viola_TN	For she did speak in starts distractedly.
Twelfth Night	2	2	471	speech	verse	Viola_TN	She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion
Twelfth Night	2	2	472	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Invites me in this churlish messenger.
Twelfth Night	2	2	473	speech	verse	Viola_TN	None of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none!
Twelfth Night	2	2	474	speech	verse	Viola_TN	I am the man. If it be so, as ’tis,
Twelfth Night	2	2	475	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Poor lady, she were better love a dream.

Twelfth Night	2	2	480	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,
Twelfth Night	2	2	481	speech	verse	Viola_TN	For such as we are made of, such we be.
Twelfth Night	2	2	482	speech	verse	Viola_TN	How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,

Twelfth Night	2	2	484	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
Twelfth Night	2	2	485	speech	verse	Viola_TN	What will become of this? As I am man,
Twelfth Night	2	2	486	speech	verse	Viola_TN	My state is desperate for my master’s love.

Twelfth Night	2	3	494	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Nay, by my troth, I know not. But I know to be up late is to be up late.
Twelfth Night	2	3	495	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early, so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements?
Twelfth Night	2	3	496	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.

Twelfth Night	2	3	502	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	By my troth, the Fool has an excellent breast.

I sent thee sixpence for thy leman. Hadst it?
Twelfth Night	2	3	503	speech	prose	Feste_TN	I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock, my lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it.

Twelfth Night	2	4	728	speech	verse	Viola_TN	But let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,
Twelfth Night	2	4	729	speech	verse	Viola_TN	Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,
Twelfth Night	2	4	730	speech	verse	Viola_TN	And with a green and yellow melancholy
Twelfth Night	2	4	731	speech	verse	Viola_TN	She sat like Patience on a monument,

I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love and, with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript.

Twelfth Night	3	1	896	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Art thou a churchman?
Twelfth Night	3	1	897	speech	prose	Feste_TN	No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.
Twelfth Night	3	1	898	speech	prose	Viola_TN	So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church.
Twelfth Night	3	1	899	speech	prose	Feste_TN	You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev’ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!
Twelfth Night	3	1	900	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Nay, that’s certain. They that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.

Twelfth Night	3	1	903	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But, indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

Twelfth Night	3	1	905	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them.

Twelfth Night	3	1	907	speech	prose	Feste_TN	Not so, sir. I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
Twelfth Night	3	1	908	speech	prose	Viola_TN	Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s Fool?
Twelfth Night	3	1	909	speech	prose	Feste_TN	No, indeed, sir. The Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no Fool, sir, till she be married, and Fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings: the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her Fool but her corrupter of words.
Twelfth Night	3	1	910	speech	prose	Viola_TN	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.

Twelfth Night	3	1	980	speech	verse	Olivia_TN	Have you not set mine honor at the stake

Twelfth Night	3	2	1042	speech	prose	Fabian_TN	She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy.
Twelfth Night	3	2	1043	speech	prose	AndrewAguecheek_TN	An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.

Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou “thou”-est him some thrice, it shall not be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.

Twelfth Night	3	2	1054	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together.

You have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor.

Twelfth Night	3	4	1168	speech	prose	Malvolio_TN	O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that in the letter: “Cast thy humble slough,” says she. “Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity,” and consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some Sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

Therefore, this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a clodpoll. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.

Twelfth Night	3	4	1233	speech	verse	Olivia_TN	There’s something in me that reproves my fault,

Twelfth Night	3	4	1258	speech	prose	Viola_TN	I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a man of that quirk.
Twelfth Night	3	4	1259	speech	prose	TobyBelch_TN	Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury. Therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
Twelfth Night	3	4	1260	speech	prose	Viola_TN	This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.

Twelfth Night	3	4	1266	speech	prose	Fabian_TN	Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor.

They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
