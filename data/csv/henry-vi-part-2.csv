Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	922	speech	verse	York_1H6	Our simple supper ended, give me leave,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	923	speech	verse	York_1H6	In this close walk, to satisfy myself
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	924	speech	verse	York_1H6	In craving your opinion of my title,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	925	speech	verse	York_1H6	Which is infallible, to England’s crown.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	926	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	My lord, I long to hear it at full.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	927	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	928	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	The Nevilles are thy subjects to command.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	929	speech	verse	York_1H6	Then thus:
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	930	speech	verse	York_1H6	Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	931	speech	verse	York_1H6	The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	932	speech	verse	York_1H6	The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	933	speech	verse	York_1H6	Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	934	speech	verse	York_1H6	Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	935	speech	verse	York_1H6	The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	936	speech	verse	York_1H6	The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	937	speech	verse	York_1H6	William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	938	speech	verse	York_1H6	Edward the Black Prince died before his father
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	939	speech	verse	York_1H6	And left behind him Richard, his only son,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	940	speech	verse	York_1H6	Who, after Edward the Third’s death, reigned as king
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	941	speech	verse	York_1H6	Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	942	speech	verse	York_1H6	The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	943	speech	verse	York_1H6	Crowned by the name of Henry the Fourth,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	944	speech	verse	York_1H6	Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	945	speech	verse	York_1H6	Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	946	speech	verse	York_1H6	And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	947	speech	verse	York_1H6	Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	948	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Father, the Duke hath told the truth.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	949	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	950	speech	verse	York_1H6	Which now they hold by force and not by right;
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	951	speech	verse	York_1H6	For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	952	speech	verse	York_1H6	The issue of the next son should have reigned.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	953	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	954	speech	verse	York_1H6	The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	955	speech	verse	York_1H6	I claim the crown, had issue, Philippa, a daughter,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	956	speech	verse	York_1H6	Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	957	speech	verse	York_1H6	Edmund had issue, Roger, Earl of March;
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	958	speech	verse	York_1H6	Roger had issue: Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	959	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	960	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	As I have read, laid claim unto the crown
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	961	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	962	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	Who kept him in captivity till he died.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	963	speech	verse	Salisbury_2H6	But to the rest.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	964	speech	verse	York_1H6	His eldest sister, Anne,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	965	speech	verse	York_1H6	My mother, being heir unto the crown,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	966	speech	verse	York_1H6	Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	967	speech	verse	York_1H6	To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	968	speech	verse	York_1H6	By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	969	speech	verse	York_1H6	To Roger, Earl of March, who was the son
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	970	speech	verse	York_1H6	Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippa,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	971	speech	verse	York_1H6	Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	972	speech	verse	York_1H6	So, if the issue of the elder son
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	973	speech	verse	York_1H6	Succeed before the younger, I am king.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	974	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	What plain proceedings is more plain than this?
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	975	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	976	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	977	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	978	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	979	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	980	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	981	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And in this private plot be we the first
Henry VI, Part 2	2	2	982	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	That shall salute our rightful sovereign

Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1231	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	With what a majesty he bears himself,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1232	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	How insolent of late he is become,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1233	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1234	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	We know the time since he was mild and affable;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1235	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And if we did but glance a far-off look,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1236	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Immediately he was upon his knee,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1237	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	That all the court admired him for submission.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1238	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But meet him now, and, be it in the morn
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1239	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	When everyone will give the time of day,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1240	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	He knits his brow and shows an angry eye
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1241	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And passeth by with stiff unbowèd knee,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1242	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1243	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1244	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But great men tremble when the lion roars—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1245	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And Humphrey is no little man in England.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1246	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	First, note that he is near you in descent,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1247	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And, should you fall, he is the next will mount.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1248	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Meseemeth then it is no policy,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1249	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1250	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And his advantage following your decease,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1251	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	That he should come about your royal person
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1252	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Or be admitted to your Highness’ Council.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1253	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	By flattery hath he won the Commons’ hearts;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1254	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And when he please to make commotion,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1255	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	’Tis to be feared they all will follow him.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1256	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1257	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Suffer them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1258	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1259	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1260	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1261	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1262	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Which fear, if better reasons can supplant,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1263	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1264	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	My lords of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1265	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Reprove my allegation if you can,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1266	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Or else conclude my words effectual.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1267	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Well hath your Highness seen into this duke,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1268	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1269	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	I think I should have told your Grace’s tale.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1270	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	The Duchess by his subornation,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1271	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Upon my life, began her devilish practices;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1272	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Or if he were not privy to those faults,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1273	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Yet, by reputing of his high descent—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1274	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	As next the King he was successive heir,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1275	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And such high vaunts of his nobility—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1276	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1277	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	By wicked means to frame our sovereign’s fall.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1278	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1279	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And in his simple show he harbors treason.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1280	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1281	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1282	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1283	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	Did he not, contrary to form of law,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1284	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	Devise strange deaths for small offenses done?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1285	speech	verse	York_1H6	And did he not, in his protectorship,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1286	speech	verse	York_1H6	Levy great sums of money through the realm
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1287	speech	verse	York_1H6	For soldiers’ pay in France, and never sent it,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1288	speech	verse	York_1H6	By means whereof the towns each day revolted?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1289	speech	verse	Buckingham_2H6	Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1290	speech	verse	Buckingham_2H6	Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1291	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	My lords, at once: the care you have of us
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1292	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1293	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Is worthy praise; but, shall I speak my conscience,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1294	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1295	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	From meaning treason to our royal person
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1296	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1297	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1298	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1299	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Ah, what’s more dangerous than this fond affiance?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1300	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Seems he a dove? His feathers are but borrowed,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1301	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	For he’s disposèd as the hateful raven.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1302	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1303	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	For he’s inclined as is the ravenous wolves.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1304	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1305	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1306	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1307	direction	entrance	Somerset_1H6	Enter Somerset.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1308	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	All health unto my gracious sovereign!
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1309	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1310	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	That all your interest in those territories
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1311	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Is utterly bereft you. All is lost.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1312	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God’s will be done.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1313	direction	delivery	York_1H6	, aside
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1314	speech	verse	York_1H6	Cold news for me, for I had hope of France
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1315	speech	verse	York_1H6	As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1316	speech	verse	York_1H6	Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1317	speech	verse	York_1H6	And caterpillars eat my leaves away.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1318	speech	verse	York_1H6	But I will remedy this gear ere long,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1319	speech	verse	York_1H6	Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1320	direction	entrance	Gloucester_2H4	Enter Gloucester.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1321	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	All happiness unto my lord the King!
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1322	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Pardon, my liege, that I have stayed so long.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1323	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1324	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1325	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	I do arrest thee of high treason here.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1326	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1327	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Nor change my countenance for this arrest.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1328	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1329	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	The purest spring is not so free from mud
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1330	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1331	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1332	speech	verse	York_1H6	’Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1333	speech	verse	York_1H6	And, being Protector, stayed the soldiers’ pay,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1334	speech	verse	York_1H6	By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1335	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1336	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	I never robbed the soldiers of their pay
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1337	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1338	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	So help me God as I have watched the night—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1339	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Ay, night by night—in studying good for England!
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1340	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	That doit that e’er I wrested from the King,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1341	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1342	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Be brought against me at my trial day!
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1343	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	No, many a pound of mine own proper store,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1344	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Because I would not tax the needy Commons,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1345	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Have I dispursèd to the garrisons
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1346	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And never asked for restitution.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1347	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1348	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	I say no more than truth, so help me God.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1349	speech	verse	York_1H6	In your protectorship, you did devise
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1350	speech	verse	York_1H6	Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1351	speech	verse	York_1H6	That England was defamed by tyranny.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1352	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Why, ’tis well known that whiles I was Protector,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1353	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Pity was all the fault that was in me;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1354	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	For I should melt at an offender’s tears,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1355	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1356	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Unless it were a bloody murderer
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1357	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1358	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	I never gave them condign punishment.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1359	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1360	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Above the felon or what trespass else.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1361	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1362	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1363	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1364	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	I do arrest you in his Highness’ name,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1365	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1366	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	To keep until your further time of trial.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1367	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	My lord of Gloucester, ’tis my special hope
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1368	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	That you will clear yourself from all suspense.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1369	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	My conscience tells me you are innocent.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1370	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1371	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Virtue is choked with foul ambition,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1372	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And charity chased hence by rancor’s hand;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1373	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Foul subornation is predominant,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1374	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And equity exiled your Highness’ land.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1375	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	I know their complot is to have my life;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1376	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And if my death might make this island happy
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1377	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And prove the period of their tyranny,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1378	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	I would expend it with all willingness.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1379	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	But mine is made the prologue to their play;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1380	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1381	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1382	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Beaufort’s red sparkling eyes blab his heart’s malice,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1383	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And Suffolk’s cloudy brow his stormy hate;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1384	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1385	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	The envious load that lies upon his heart;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1386	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1387	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Whose overweening arm I have plucked back,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1388	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	By false accuse doth level at my life.—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1389	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1390	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Causeless have laid disgraces on my head
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1391	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And with your best endeavor have stirred up
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1392	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	My liefest liege to be mine enemy.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1393	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Ay, all of you have laid your heads together—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1394	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Myself had notice of your conventicles—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1395	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And all to make away my guiltless life.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1396	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	I shall not want false witness to condemn me
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1397	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1398	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	The ancient proverb will be well effected:
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1399	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	“A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.”
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1400	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	My liege, his railing is intolerable.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1401	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	If those that care to keep your royal person
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1402	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	From treason’s secret knife and traitor’s rage
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1403	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1404	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	And the offender granted scope of speech,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1405	speech	verse	CardinalBeaufort_1H6	’Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1406	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1407	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	With ignominious words, though clerkly couched,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1408	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	As if she had subornèd some to swear
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1409	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	False allegations to o’erthrow his state?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1410	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But I can give the loser leave to chide.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1411	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Far truer spoke than meant. I lose, indeed;
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1412	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Beshrew the winners, for they played me false!
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1413	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And well such losers may have leave to speak.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1414	speech	verse	Buckingham_2H6	He’ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day.

Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1420	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,

Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1427	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	What, will your Highness leave the Parliament?
Henry VI, Part 2	3	1	1428	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Ay, Margaret. My heart is drowned with grief,

Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1725	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1726	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore

Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1729	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And would not dash me with their ragged sides
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1730	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1731	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1732	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1733	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1734	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1735	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And when the dusky sky began to rob
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1736	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	My earnest-gaping sight of thy land’s view,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1737	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	I took a costly jewel from my neck—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1738	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	A heart it was, bound in with diamonds—
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1739	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And threw it towards thy land. The sea received it,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1740	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And so I wished thy body might my heart.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1741	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And even with this I lost fair England’s view,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1742	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1743	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And called them blind and dusky spectacles
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1744	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	For losing ken of Albion’s wishèd coast.
Henry VI, Part 2	3	2	1745	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	How often have I tempted Suffolk’s tongue,

Thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer.
