Cymbeline	1	1	1	direction	entrance	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	Enter two Gentlemen.
Cymbeline	1	1	2	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods
Cymbeline	1	1	3	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	No more obey the heavens than our courtiers’
Cymbeline	1	1	4	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Still seem as does the King’s.
Cymbeline	1	1	5	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	But what’s the matter?
Cymbeline	1	1	6	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	His daughter, and the heir of ’s kingdom, whom
Cymbeline	1	1	7	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	He purposed to his wife’s sole son—a widow
Cymbeline	1	1	8	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	That late he married—hath referred herself
Cymbeline	1	1	9	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded,
Cymbeline	1	1	10	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Her husband banished, she imprisoned. All
Cymbeline	1	1	11	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
Cymbeline	1	1	12	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Be touched at very heart.
Cymbeline	1	1	13	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	None but the King?
Cymbeline	1	1	14	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	He that hath lost her, too. So is the Queen,
Cymbeline	1	1	15	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	That most desired the match. But not a courtier,
Cymbeline	1	1	16	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Although they wear their faces to the bent
Cymbeline	1	1	17	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not
Cymbeline	1	1	18	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Glad at the thing they scowl at.
Cymbeline	1	1	19	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	And why so?
Cymbeline	1	1	20	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	He that hath missed the Princess is a thing
Cymbeline	1	1	21	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Too bad for bad report, and he that hath her—
Cymbeline	1	1	22	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
Cymbeline	1	1	23	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	And therefore banished—is a creature such
Cymbeline	1	1	24	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	As, to seek through the regions of the Earth
Cymbeline	1	1	25	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	For one his like, there would be something failing
Cymbeline	1	1	26	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	In him that should compare. I do not think
Cymbeline	1	1	27	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	So fair an outward and such stuff within
Cymbeline	1	1	28	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Endows a man but he.
Cymbeline	1	1	29	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	You speak him far.
Cymbeline	1	1	30	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	I do extend him, sir, within himself,
Cymbeline	1	1	31	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Crush him together rather than unfold
Cymbeline	1	1	32	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	His measure duly.
Cymbeline	1	1	33	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	What’s his name and birth?
Cymbeline	1	1	34	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	I cannot delve him to the root. His father
Cymbeline	1	1	35	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Was called Sicilius, who did join his honor
Cymbeline	1	1	36	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
Cymbeline	1	1	37	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
Cymbeline	1	1	38	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	He served with glory and admired success,
Cymbeline	1	1	39	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	So gained the sur-addition Leonatus;
Cymbeline	1	1	40	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Cymbeline	1	1	41	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Two other sons, who in the wars o’ th’ time
Cymbeline	1	1	42	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Died with their swords in hand. For which their father,
Cymbeline	1	1	43	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
Cymbeline	1	1	44	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	That he quit being; and his gentle lady,
Cymbeline	1	1	45	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
Cymbeline	1	1	46	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	As he was born. The King he takes the babe
Cymbeline	1	1	47	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Cymbeline	1	1	48	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,
Cymbeline	1	1	49	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Cymbeline	1	1	50	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Could make him the receiver of, which he took
Cymbeline	1	1	51	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	As we do air, fast as ’twas ministered,
Cymbeline	1	1	52	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	And in ’s spring became a harvest; lived in court—
Cymbeline	1	1	53	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Which rare it is to do—most praised, most loved,
Cymbeline	1	1	54	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	A sample to the youngest, to th’ more mature
Cymbeline	1	1	55	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	A glass that feated them, and to the graver
Cymbeline	1	1	56	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
Cymbeline	1	1	57	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	For whom he now is banished, her own price
Cymbeline	1	1	58	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Proclaims how she esteemed him; and his virtue
Cymbeline	1	1	59	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	By her election may be truly read
Cymbeline	1	1	60	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	What kind of man he is.
Cymbeline	1	1	61	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	I honor him
Cymbeline	1	1	62	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
Cymbeline	1	1	63	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	Is she sole child to th’ King?
Cymbeline	1	1	64	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	His only child.
Cymbeline	1	1	65	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	He had two sons—if this be worth your hearing,
Cymbeline	1	1	66	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Mark it—the eldest of them at three years old,
Cymbeline	1	1	67	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	I’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
Cymbeline	1	1	68	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Were stol’n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge

Cymbeline	1	1	70	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	How long is this ago?
Cymbeline	1	1	71	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Some twenty years.
Cymbeline	1	1	72	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	That a king’s children should be so conveyed,
Cymbeline	1	1	73	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
Cymbeline	1	1	74	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.2_Cym	That could not trace them!
Cymbeline	1	1	75	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Howsoe’er ’tis strange,
Cymbeline	1	1	76	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.1_Cym	Or that the negligence may well be laughed at,

Cymbeline	1	3	293	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Madam, so I did.
Cymbeline	1	3	294	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	I would have broke mine eyestrings, cracked them, but
Cymbeline	1	3	295	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	To look upon him till the diminution
Cymbeline	1	3	296	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;

Cymbeline	1	3	303	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	I did not take my leave of him, but had

Cymbeline	1	4	325	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of. But I could then have looked on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
Cymbeline	1	4	326	speech	prose	Philario_Cym	You speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.
Cymbeline	1	4	327	speech	prose	Frenchman_Cym	I have seen him in France. We had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
Cymbeline	1	4	328	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	This matter of marrying his king’s daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
Cymbeline	1	4	329	speech	prose	Frenchman_Cym	And then his banishment.
Cymbeline	1	4	330	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality.—But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?

Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing, to a stranger of his quality.—I beseech you all, be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing.
Cymbeline	1	4	334	direction	delivery	Frenchman_Cym	, to Posthumus
Cymbeline	1	4	335	speech	prose	Frenchman_Cym	Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
Cymbeline	1	4	336	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
Cymbeline	1	4	337	speech	prose	Frenchman_Cym	Sir, you o’errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.
Cymbeline	1	4	338	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveler, rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others’ experiences. But upon my mended judgment— if I offend not to say it is mended—my quarrel was not altogether slight.
Cymbeline	1	4	339	speech	prose	Frenchman_Cym	Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrament of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall’n both.
Cymbeline	1	4	340	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Can we with manners ask what was the difference?
Cymbeline	1	4	341	speech	prose	Frenchman_Cym	Safely, I think. ’Twas a contention in public, which may without contradiction suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses, this gentleman at that time vouching—and upon warrant of bloody affirmation— his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
Cymbeline	1	4	342	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	That lady is not now living, or this gentleman’s opinion by this worn out.
Cymbeline	1	4	343	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
Cymbeline	1	4	344	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	You must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of Italy.
Cymbeline	1	4	345	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.
Cymbeline	1	4	346	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	As fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she went before others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlusters many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many. But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
Cymbeline	1	4	347	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	I praised her as I rated her. So do I my stone.
Cymbeline	1	4	348	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	What do you esteem it at?
Cymbeline	1	4	349	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	More than the world enjoys.
Cymbeline	1	4	350	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she’s outprized by a trifle.
Cymbeline	1	4	351	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	You are mistaken. The one may be sold or given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift. The other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
Cymbeline	1	4	352	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Which the gods have given you?
Cymbeline	1	4	353	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	Which, by their graces, I will keep.
Cymbeline	1	4	354	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	You may wear her in title yours, but you know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds. Your ring may be stolen too. So your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual. A cunning thief or a that-way-accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last.
Cymbeline	1	4	355	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
Cymbeline	1	4	356	speech	prose	Philario_Cym	Let us leave here, gentlemen.
Cymbeline	1	4	357	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me. We are familiar at first.
Cymbeline	1	4	358	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress, make her go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
Cymbeline	1	4	359	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	No, no.
Cymbeline	1	4	360	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which in my opinion o’ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation, and, to bar your offense herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.
Cymbeline	1	4	361	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	You are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what you’re worthy of by your attempt.
Cymbeline	1	4	362	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	What’s that?
Cymbeline	1	4	363	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	A repulse—though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more: a punishment, too.
Cymbeline	1	4	364	speech	prose	Philario_Cym	Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly. Let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be better acquainted.
Cymbeline	1	4	365	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Would I had put my estate and my neighbor’s on th’ approbation of what I have spoke.
Cymbeline	1	4	366	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	What lady would you choose to assail?
Cymbeline	1	4	367	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honor of hers which you imagine so reserved.
Cymbeline	1	4	368	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger; ’tis part of it.
Cymbeline	1	4	369	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.
Cymbeline	1	4	370	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	This is but a custom in your tongue. You bear a graver purpose, I hope.
Cymbeline	1	4	371	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	I am the master of my speeches and would undergo what’s spoken, I swear.
Cymbeline	1	4	372	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between ’s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match. Here’s my ring.
Cymbeline	1	4	373	speech	prose	Philario_Cym	I will have it no lay.
Cymbeline	1	4	374	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	By the gods, it is one!—If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off and leave her in such honor as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours, provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.
Cymbeline	1	4	375	speech	prose	Posthumus_Cym	I embrace these conditions. Let us have articles betwixt us. Only thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If she remain unseduced, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th’ assault you have made to her chastity, you shall answer me with your sword.
Cymbeline	1	4	376	speech	prose	Iachimo_Cym	Your hand; a covenant.

Cymbeline	1	5	395	speech	verse	Cornelius_Cym	Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
Cymbeline	1	5	396	speech	verse	Cornelius_Cym	Which are the movers of a languishing death,

Cymbeline	1	5	398	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	I wonder, doctor,
Cymbeline	1	5	399	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been
Cymbeline	1	5	400	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learned me how
Cymbeline	1	5	401	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	To make perfumes, distil, preserve—yea, so
Cymbeline	1	5	402	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	That our great king himself doth woo me oft
Cymbeline	1	5	403	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,
Cymbeline	1	5	404	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	Unless thou think’st me devilish, is ’t not meet
Cymbeline	1	5	405	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	That I did amplify my judgment in
Cymbeline	1	5	406	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Cymbeline	1	5	407	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
Cymbeline	1	5	408	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	We count not worth the hanging—but none human—
Cymbeline	1	5	409	speech	verse	Queen_Cym	To try the vigor of them and apply

Cymbeline	1	5	412	speech	verse	Cornelius_Cym	Your Highness

Cymbeline	1	6	611	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Something of me or what concerns me. Pray you,
Cymbeline	1	6	612	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Cymbeline	1	6	613	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Than to be sure they do—for certainties

Cymbeline	1	6	615	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	The remedy then born—discover to me
Cymbeline	1	6	616	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	What both you spur and stop.
Cymbeline	1	6	617	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Had I this cheek

Cymbeline	1	6	641	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	So fair, and fastened to an empery
Cymbeline	1	6	642	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Would make the great’st king double, to be partnered
Cymbeline	1	6	643	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	With tomboys hired with that self exhibition
Cymbeline	1	6	644	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Which your own coffers yield, with diseased ventures
Cymbeline	1	6	645	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	That play with all infirmities for gold
Cymbeline	1	6	646	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Which rottenness can lend nature; such boiled stuff
Cymbeline	1	6	647	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	As well might poison poison. Be revenged,

Cymbeline	1	6	651	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	How should I be revenged? If this be true—

Cymbeline	2	4	1102	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Good sir, we must,

Cymbeline	2	4	1116	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Sir, my circumstances,

Cymbeline	2	4	1118	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Must first induce you to believe; whose strength
Cymbeline	2	4	1119	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	I will confirm with oath, which I doubt not

Cymbeline	2	4	1130	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
Cymbeline	2	4	1131	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	In workmanship and value, which I wondered
Cymbeline	2	4	1132	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Could be so rarely and exactly wrought
Cymbeline	2	4	1133	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Since the true life on ’t was—
Cymbeline	2	4	1134	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	This is true,
Cymbeline	2	4	1135	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	And this you might have heard of here, by me
Cymbeline	2	4	1136	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	Or by some other.
Cymbeline	2	4	1137	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	More particulars

Cymbeline	2	4	1142	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
Cymbeline	2	4	1143	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
Cymbeline	2	4	1144	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	So likely to report themselves; the cutter
Cymbeline	2	4	1145	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Was as another Nature, dumb, outwent her,
Cymbeline	2	4	1146	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Motion and breath left out.
Cymbeline	2	4	1147	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	This is a thing

Cymbeline	2	4	1151	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons—

Cymbeline	2	4	1153	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
Cymbeline	2	4	1154	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Depending on their brands.
Cymbeline	2	4	1155	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	This is her honor?
Cymbeline	2	4	1156	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	Let it be granted you have seen all this—and praise
Cymbeline	2	4	1157	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	Be given to your remembrance—the description

Cymbeline	2	4	1159	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	The wager you have laid.
Cymbeline	2	4	1160	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Then if you can

Cymbeline	2	4	1168	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Sir, I thank her, that.
Cymbeline	2	4	1169	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	She stripped it from her arm. I see her yet.
Cymbeline	2	4	1170	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	Her pretty action did outsell her gift
Cymbeline	2	4	1171	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	And yet enriched it too. She gave it me
Cymbeline	2	4	1172	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	And said she prized it once.
Cymbeline	2	4	1173	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	Maybe she plucked it off
Cymbeline	2	4	1174	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	To send it me.
Cymbeline	2	4	1175	speech	verse	Iachimo_Cym	She writes so to you, doth she?

Cymbeline	2	4	1204	speech	verse	Posthumus_Cym	Is this. She hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.

Cymbeline	3	4	1667	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	O gracious lady,
Cymbeline	3	4	1668	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Since I received command to do this business

Cymbeline	3	4	1670	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Do ’t, and to bed, then.
Cymbeline	3	4	1671	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	I’ll wake mine eyeballs out first.
Cymbeline	3	4	1672	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Wherefore then
Cymbeline	3	4	1673	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
Cymbeline	3	4	1674	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	So many miles with a pretense? This place?
Cymbeline	3	4	1675	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Mine action and thine own? Our horses’ labor?
Cymbeline	3	4	1676	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	The time inviting thee? The perturbed court
Cymbeline	3	4	1677	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	For my being absent, whereunto I never
Cymbeline	3	4	1678	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Purpose return? Why hast thou gone so far
Cymbeline	3	4	1679	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	To be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand,
Cymbeline	3	4	1680	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Th’ elected deer before thee?
Cymbeline	3	4	1681	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	But to win time
Cymbeline	3	4	1682	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	To lose so bad employment, in the which
Cymbeline	3	4	1683	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	I have considered of a course. Good lady,
Cymbeline	3	4	1684	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Hear me with patience.
Cymbeline	3	4	1685	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Talk thy tongue weary. Speak.
Cymbeline	3	4	1686	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,
Cymbeline	3	4	1687	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Cymbeline	3	4	1688	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
Cymbeline	3	4	1689	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Then, madam,
Cymbeline	3	4	1690	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	I thought you would not back again.
Cymbeline	3	4	1691	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Most like,
Cymbeline	3	4	1692	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Bringing me here to kill me.
Cymbeline	3	4	1693	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Not so, neither.
Cymbeline	3	4	1694	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	But if I were as wise as honest, then
Cymbeline	3	4	1695	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
Cymbeline	3	4	1696	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	But that my master is abused. Some villain,
Cymbeline	3	4	1697	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Ay, and singular in his art, hath done
Cymbeline	3	4	1698	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	You both this cursèd injury.
Cymbeline	3	4	1699	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Some Roman courtesan?
Cymbeline	3	4	1700	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	No, on my life.
Cymbeline	3	4	1701	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	I’ll give but notice you are dead, and send him
Cymbeline	3	4	1702	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Some bloody sign of it, for ’tis commanded
Cymbeline	3	4	1703	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	I should do so. You shall be missed at court,
Cymbeline	3	4	1704	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	And that will well confirm it.
Cymbeline	3	4	1705	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Why, good fellow,
Cymbeline	3	4	1706	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	What shall I do the while? Where bide? How live?
Cymbeline	3	4	1707	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Or in my life what comfort when I am
Cymbeline	3	4	1708	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Dead to my husband?
Cymbeline	3	4	1709	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	If you’ll back to th’ court—
Cymbeline	3	4	1710	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	No court, no father, nor no more ado
Cymbeline	3	4	1711	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
Cymbeline	3	4	1712	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	That Cloten, whose love suit hath been to me
Cymbeline	3	4	1713	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	As fearful as a siege.
Cymbeline	3	4	1714	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	If not at court,
Cymbeline	3	4	1715	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Then not in Britain must you bide.
Cymbeline	3	4	1716	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Where, then?
Cymbeline	3	4	1717	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
Cymbeline	3	4	1718	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Are they not but in Britain? I’ th’ world’s volume
Cymbeline	3	4	1719	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Our Britain seems as of it, but not in ’t,
Cymbeline	3	4	1720	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee think
Cymbeline	3	4	1721	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	There’s livers out of Britain.
Cymbeline	3	4	1722	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	I am most glad
Cymbeline	3	4	1723	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	You think of other place. Th’ ambassador,
Cymbeline	3	4	1724	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford Haven
Cymbeline	3	4	1725	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Tomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind
Cymbeline	3	4	1726	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
Cymbeline	3	4	1727	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	That which t’ appear itself must not yet be
Cymbeline	3	4	1728	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	But by self-danger, you should tread a course
Cymbeline	3	4	1729	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Pretty and full of view: yea, haply near
Cymbeline	3	4	1730	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,
Cymbeline	3	4	1731	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	That though his actions were not visible, yet
Cymbeline	3	4	1732	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Report should render him hourly to your ear
Cymbeline	3	4	1733	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	As truly as he moves.
Cymbeline	3	4	1734	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	O, for such means,
Cymbeline	3	4	1735	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	Though peril to my modesty, not death on ’t,
Cymbeline	3	4	1736	speech	verse	Imogen_Cym	I would adventure.
Cymbeline	3	4	1737	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Well then, here’s the point:
Cymbeline	3	4	1738	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	You must forget to be a woman; change
Cymbeline	3	4	1739	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Command into obedience, fear and niceness—
Cymbeline	3	4	1740	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
Cymbeline	3	4	1741	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Woman it pretty self—into a waggish courage,
Cymbeline	3	4	1742	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Ready in gibes, quick-answered, saucy, and
Cymbeline	3	4	1743	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must
Cymbeline	3	4	1744	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
Cymbeline	3	4	1745	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Exposing it—but O, the harder heart!
Cymbeline	3	4	1746	speech	verse	Pisanio_Cym	Alack, no remedy—to the greedy touch

Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber. I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his, no less young, more strong; not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off, thy mistress enforced, thy garments cut to pieces before thy face; and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may haply be a little angry or my so rough usage. But my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a sore purpose. Fortune, put them into my hand!

But the comfort is, you shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern bills, which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being too light; the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what’s past, is, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.
