Henry VI, Part 1	1	1	126	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.ENGLISH.3_1H6	To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
Henry VI, Part 1	1	1	127	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.ENGLISH.3_1H6	More than three hours the fight continuèd,
Henry VI, Part 1	1	1	128	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.ENGLISH.3_1H6	Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,

Henry VI, Part 1	1	1	138	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.ENGLISH.3_1H6	If Sir John Fastolf had not played the coward.

Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	946	speech	verse	York_1H6	Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	947	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	948	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	The garden here is more convenient.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	949	speech	verse	York_1H6	Then say at once if I maintained the truth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	950	speech	verse	York_1H6	Or else was wrangling Somerset in th’ error?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	951	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Faith, I have been a truant in the law
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	952	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And never yet could frame my will to it,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	953	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And therefore frame the law unto my will.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	954	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	955	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	956	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	957	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Between two blades, which bears the better temper,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	958	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Between two horses, which doth bear him best,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	959	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	960	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	961	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	962	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	963	speech	verse	York_1H6	Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance!
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	964	speech	verse	York_1H6	The truth appears so naked on my side
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	965	speech	verse	York_1H6	That any purblind eye may find it out.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	966	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	And on my side it is so well appareled,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	967	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	So clear, so shining, and so evident,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	968	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	That it will glimmer through a blind man’s eye.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	969	speech	verse	York_1H6	Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	970	speech	verse	York_1H6	In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	971	speech	verse	York_1H6	Let him that is a trueborn gentleman
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	972	speech	verse	York_1H6	And stands upon the honor of his birth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	973	speech	verse	York_1H6	If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	974	speech	verse	York_1H6	From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	975	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	976	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	But dare maintain the party of the truth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	977	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	978	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	I love no colors; and, without all color
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	979	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Of base insinuating flattery,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	980	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	981	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	982	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And say withal I think he held the right.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	983	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	984	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	Till you conclude that he upon whose side
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	985	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	The fewest roses are croppèd from the tree
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	986	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	987	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	988	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	989	speech	verse	York_1H6	And I.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	990	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	Then for the truth and plainness of the case,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	991	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	992	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	993	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	994	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	995	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	And fall on my side so against your will.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	996	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	997	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	998	speech	verse	Vernon_1H6	And keep me on the side where still I am.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	999	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Well, well, come on, who else?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1000	speech	verse	Lawyer_1H6	Unless my study and my books be false,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1001	speech	verse	Lawyer_1H6	The argument you held was wrong in law,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1002	speech	verse	Lawyer_1H6	In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1003	speech	verse	York_1H6	Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1004	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Here in my scabbard, meditating that
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1005	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1006	speech	verse	York_1H6	Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1007	speech	verse	York_1H6	For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1008	speech	verse	York_1H6	The truth on our side.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1009	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	No, Plantagenet.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1010	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	’Tis not for fear, but anger that thy cheeks
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1011	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1012	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1013	speech	verse	York_1H6	Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1014	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1015	speech	verse	York_1H6	Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1016	speech	verse	York_1H6	Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1017	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Well, I’ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1018	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	That shall maintain what I have said is true,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1019	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1020	speech	verse	York_1H6	Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1021	speech	verse	York_1H6	I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1022	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1023	speech	verse	York_1H6	Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1024	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	I’ll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1025	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Away, away, good William de la Pole!
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1026	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1027	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Now, by God’s will, thou wrong’st him, Somerset.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1028	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	His grandfather was Lionel, Duke of Clarence,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1029	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Third son to the third Edward, King of England.

Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1032	speech	verse	York_1H6	Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1033	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	By Him that made me, I’ll maintain my words
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1034	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	On any plot of ground in Christendom.

Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1037	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	And, by his treason, stand’st not thou attainted,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1038	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1039	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1040	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1041	speech	verse	York_1H6	My father was attachèd, not attainted,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1042	speech	verse	York_1H6	Condemned to die for treason, but no traitor;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1043	speech	verse	York_1H6	And that I’ll prove on better men than Somerset,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1044	speech	verse	York_1H6	Were growing time once ripened to my will.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1045	speech	verse	York_1H6	For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1046	speech	verse	York_1H6	I’ll note you in my book of memory
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1047	speech	verse	York_1H6	To scourge you for this apprehension.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1048	speech	verse	York_1H6	Look to it well, and say you are well warned.

Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1051	speech	verse	Somerset_1H6	For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1052	speech	verse	York_1H6	And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1053	speech	verse	York_1H6	As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1054	speech	verse	York_1H6	Will I forever, and my faction, wear

Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1064	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Shall be whipped out in the next parliament,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1065	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Called for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1066	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	And if thou be not then created York,

Henry VI, Part 1	2	4	1068	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,

Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1132	speech	verse	York_1H6	Some words there grew ’twixt Somerset and me,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1133	speech	verse	York_1H6	Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1134	speech	verse	York_1H6	And did upbraid me with my father’s death;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1135	speech	verse	York_1H6	Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1136	speech	verse	York_1H6	Else with the like I had requited him.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1137	speech	verse	York_1H6	Therefore, good uncle, for my father’s sake,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1138	speech	verse	York_1H6	In honor of a true Plantagenet,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1139	speech	verse	York_1H6	And for alliance’ sake, declare the cause
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1140	speech	verse	York_1H6	My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1141	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	That cause, fair nephew, that imprisoned me
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1142	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And hath detained me all my flow’ring youth
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1143	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1144	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Was cursèd instrument of his decease.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1145	speech	verse	York_1H6	Discover more at large what cause that was,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1146	speech	verse	York_1H6	For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1147	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	I will, if that my fading breath permit
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1148	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And death approach not ere my tale be done.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1149	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1150	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward’s son,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1151	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	The first begotten and the lawful heir
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1152	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Of Edward king, the third of that descent;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1153	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	During whose reign the Percies of the north,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1154	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Finding his usurpation most unjust,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1155	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Endeavored my advancement to the throne.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1156	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	The reason moved these warlike lords to this
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1157	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Was, for that—young Richard thus removed,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1158	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Leaving no heir begotten of his body—
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1159	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	I was the next by birth and parentage;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1160	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	For by my mother I derivèd am
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1161	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	From Lionel, Duke of Clarence, third son
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1162	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	To King Edward the Third; whereas he
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1163	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1164	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Being but fourth of that heroic line.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1165	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	But mark: as in this haughty great attempt
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1166	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	They laborèd to plant the rightful heir,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1167	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	I lost my liberty and they their lives.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1168	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1169	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1170	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, derived
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1171	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1172	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1173	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Again, in pity of my hard distress,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1174	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Levied an army, weening to redeem
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1175	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And have installed me in the diadem.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1176	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1177	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1178	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	In whom the title rested, were suppressed.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1179	speech	verse	York_1H6	Of which, my lord, your Honor is the last.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1180	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	True, and thou seest that I no issue have
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1181	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And that my fainting words do warrant death.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1182	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1183	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	But yet be wary in thy studious care.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1184	speech	verse	York_1H6	Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1185	speech	verse	York_1H6	But yet methinks my father’s execution
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1186	speech	verse	York_1H6	Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1187	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	With silence, nephew, be thou politic;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1188	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Strong-fixèd is the house of Lancaster,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1189	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And, like a mountain, not to be removed.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1190	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	But now thy uncle is removing hence,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1191	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	As princes do their courts when they are cloyed
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1192	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	With long continuance in a settled place.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1193	speech	verse	York_1H6	O uncle, would some part of my young years
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1194	speech	verse	York_1H6	Might but redeem the passage of your age.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1195	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1196	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1197	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1198	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	Only give order for my funeral.
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1199	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1200	speech	verse	Mortimer_1H4	And prosperous be thy life in peace and war.

Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1204	speech	verse	York_1H6	And like a hermit overpassed thy days.—
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1205	speech	verse	York_1H6	Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1206	speech	verse	York_1H6	And what I do imagine, let that rest.—
Henry VI, Part 1	2	5	1207	speech	verse	York_1H6	Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2790	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	Because you want the grace that others have,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2791	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	You judge it straight a thing impossible

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2793	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	No, misconceivèd! Joan of Arc hath been

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2797	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2798	speech	verse	York_1H6	Ay, ay.—Away with her to execution.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2799	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	And hark you, sirs: because she is a maid,

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2813	speech	verse	York_1H6	She and the Dauphin have been juggling.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2814	speech	verse	York_1H6	I did imagine what would be her refuge.

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2816	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Especially since Charles must father it.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2817	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	You are deceived; my child is none of his.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2818	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	It was Alanson that enjoyed my love.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2819	speech	verse	York_1H6	Alanson, that notorious Machiavel?

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2823	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevailed.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2824	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	A married man? That’s most intolerable.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2825	speech	verse	York_1H6	Why, here’s a girl! I think she knows not well—
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2826	speech	verse	York_1H6	There were so many—whom she may accuse.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2827	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	It’s sign she hath been liberal and free.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2828	speech	verse	York_1H6	And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure!—
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2829	speech	verse	York_1H6	Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2830	speech	verse	York_1H6	Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2831	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse:
Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2832	speech	verse	Pucelle_1H6	May never glorious sun reflex his beams

Henry VI, Part 1	5	4	2897	speech	verse	York_1H6	And, now the matter grows to compromise,

Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2938	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Is but a preface of her worthy praise.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2939	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	The chief perfections of that lovely dame,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2940	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2941	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Would make a volume of enticing lines
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2942	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Able to ravish any dull conceit;
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2943	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And, which is more, she is not so divine,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2944	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	So full replete with choice of all delights,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2945	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	But with as humble lowliness of mind
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2946	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	She is content to be at your command—
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2947	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents—
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2948	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	To love and honor Henry as her lord.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2949	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	And otherwise will Henry ne’er presume.—
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2950	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent

Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2952	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	So should I give consent to flatter sin.

Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2957	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;

Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2962	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And therefore may be broke without offense.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2963	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2964	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Her father is no better than an earl,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2965	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Although in glorious titles he excel.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2966	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	Yes, my lord, her father is a king,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2967	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	The King of Naples and Jerusalem,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2968	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And of such great authority in France
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2969	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	As his alliance will confirm our peace,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2970	speech	verse	Suffolk_1H6	And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2971	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2972	speech	verse	Gloucester_2H4	Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2973	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Besides, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
Henry VI, Part 1	5	5	2974	speech	verse	Exeter_H5	Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
