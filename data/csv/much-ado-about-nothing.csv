Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	2	direction	business	Leonato_Ado	, with a letter
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	3	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	4	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I left him.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	5	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	6	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	But few of any sort, and none of name.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	7	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	8	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	9	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	10	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	11	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Did he break out into tears?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	12	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	In great measure.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	13	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	14	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	15	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	16	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	What is he that you ask for, niece?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	17	speech	prose	Hero_Ado	My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	18	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	O, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	19	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s Fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	20	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	21	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	22	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	23	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	And a good soldier too, lady.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	24	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	25	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	26	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuffed man, but for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	27	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	28	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict, four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one, so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	29	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	Is ’t possible?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	30	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	31	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	32	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	33	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	34	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	35	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	I will hold friends with you, lady.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	36	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Do, good friend.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	37	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	You will never run mad, niece.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	38	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	No, not till a hot January.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	39	speech	prose	MESSENGERS.LEONATO.1_Ado	Don Pedro is approached.

Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	40	direction	entrance	DonJohn_Ado	Enter Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, with Claudio,Benedick, Balthasar, and John the Bastard.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	41	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	42	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain, but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	43	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	You embrace your charge too willingly.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	44	direction	delivery	DonPedro_Ado	Turning to Hero.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	45	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I think this is your daughter.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	46	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Her mother hath many times told me so.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	47	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	48	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	49	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself.—Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	50	direction	business	Leonato_Ado	Leonato and the Prince move aside.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	50	direction	business	DonPedro_Ado	Leonato and the Prince move aside.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	51	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	52	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick, nobody marks you.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	53	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	54	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	55	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	56	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	A dear happiness to women. They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	57	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentleman or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	58	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	59	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	60	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	61	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer, but keep your way, i’ God’s name, I have done.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	62	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	You always end with a jade’s trick. I know you of old.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	63	direction	business	Leonato_Ado	Leonato and the Prince come forward.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	63	direction	business	DonPedro_Ado	Leonato and the Prince come forward.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	64	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	65	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. Let me bid you welcome, my lord, being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	66	direction	delivery	Leonato_Ado	To Don John.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	67	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	68	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Please it your Grace lead on?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	69	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.

Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	71	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	72	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I noted her not, but I looked on her.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	73	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Is she not a modest young lady?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	74	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	75	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	No, I pray thee, speak in sober judgment.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	76	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise. Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	77	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	78	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Would you buy her that you enquire after her?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	79	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Can the world buy such a jewel?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	80	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	81	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	82	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There’s her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	83	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	84	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Is ’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith, an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	85	direction	entrance	DonPedro_Ado	Enter Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	86	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato’s?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	87	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	88	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I charge thee on thy allegiance.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	89	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a dumb man, I would have you think so, but on my allegiance—mark you this, on my allegiance—he is in love. With who? Now, that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	90	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	If this were so, so were it uttered.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	91	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Like the old tale, my lord: “It is not so, nor ’twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.”
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	92	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	93	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	94	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	95	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	By my troth, I speak my thought.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	96	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	97	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	98	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	That I love her, I feel.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	99	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	That she is worthy, I know.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	100	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me. I will die in it at the stake.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	101	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	102	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	103	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks. But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none. And the fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	104	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	105	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	106	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	107	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	108	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Well, as time shall try. In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	109	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write “Here is good horse to hire” let them signify under my sign “Here you may see Benedick the married man.”
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	110	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	111	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	112	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I look for an earthquake too, then.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	113	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s. Commend me to him, and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	114	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you—
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	115	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had it—
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	116	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	117	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience. And so I leave you.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	118	direction	exit	Benedick_Ado	He exits.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	119	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	My liege, your Highness now may do me good.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	120	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	121	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	122	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	123	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	124	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	125	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	126	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	O, my lord,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	127	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	When you went onward on this ended action,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	128	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	129	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	130	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	Than to drive liking to the name of love.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	131	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	But now I am returned and that war thoughts
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	132	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	133	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	134	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	135	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	136	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	Thou wilt be like a lover presently
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	137	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And tire the hearer with a book of words.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	138	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	139	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And I will break with her and with her father,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	140	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And thou shalt have her. Was ’t not to this end
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	141	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	142	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	How sweetly you do minister to love,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	143	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	That know love’s grief by his complexion!
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	144	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	145	speech	verse	Claudio_Ado	I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	146	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	147	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	The fairest grant is the necessity.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	148	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	Look what will serve is fit. ’Tis once, thou lovest,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	149	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And I will fit thee with the remedy.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	150	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	I know we shall have reveling tonight.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	151	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	I will assume thy part in some disguise
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	152	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	153	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	154	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And take her hearing prisoner with the force
Much Ado About Nothing	1	1	155	speech	verse	DonPedro_Ado	And strong encounter of my amorous tale.

Much Ado About Nothing	1	2	161	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	2	162	speech	prose	LeonatosBrother_Ado	He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	2	163	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Are they good?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	2	164	speech	prose	LeonatosBrother_Ado	As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.

Much Ado About Nothing	1	2	167	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself. But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.

Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	172	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	What the goodyear, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	173	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	There is no measure in the occasion that breeds. Therefore the sadness is without limit.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	174	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	You should hear reason.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	175	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	176	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	177	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am. I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	178	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	179	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	180	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	Can you make no use of your discontent?

Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	184	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	185	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	186	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	187	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Who, the most exquisite Claudio?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	188	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Even he.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	189	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	A proper squire. And who, and who? Which way looks he?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	190	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	191	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	A very forward March chick! How came you to this?
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	192	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference. I whipped me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
Much Ado About Nothing	1	3	193	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	201	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	202	speech	prose	Hero_Ado	He is of a very melancholy disposition.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	203	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick. The one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	204	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s face—
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	205	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if he could get her goodwill.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	206	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	207	speech	prose	LeonatosBrother_Ado	In faith, she’s too curst.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	208	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God’s sending that way, for it is said “God sends a curst cow short horns,” but to a cow too curst, he sends none.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	209	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	210	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Just, if He send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at Him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in the woolen!
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	211	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	212	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead his apes into hell.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	213	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Well then, go you into hell?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	214	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter; for the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	216	speech	prose	LeonatosBrother_Ado	Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	217	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say “Father, as it please you.” But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say “Father, as it please me.”
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	218	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	219	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	220	direction	delivery	Leonato_Ado	, to Hero
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	221	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	222	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	223	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	224	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	310	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Whither?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	311	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Even to the next willow, about your own business, county. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck like an usurer’s chain? Or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf? You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	312	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	I wish him joy of her.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	313	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	314	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	I pray you, leave me.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	315	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Ho, now you strike like the blind man. ’Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.

Ha, it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed! It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	320	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see him?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	321	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the goodwill of this young lady, and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	322	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	To be whipped? What’s his fault?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	323	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	324	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	325	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too, for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s nest.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	326	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	327	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	328	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	329	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	O, she misused me past the endurance of a block! An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her. My very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the North Star. I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed. She would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire, too. Come, talk not of her. You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither. So indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	332	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Will your Grace command me any service to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on. I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John’s foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham’s beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	338	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for it, a double heart for his single one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice. Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	339	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	340	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	341	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Why, how now, count, wherefore are you sad?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	342	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Not sad, my lord.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	343	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	How then, sick?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	344	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Neither, my lord.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	345	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	346	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true, though I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false.—Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained. Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	347	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes. His Grace hath made the match, and all grace say “Amen” to it.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	348	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Speak, count, ’tis your cue.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	349	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were but little happy if I could say how much.—Lady, as you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	350	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	351	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	352	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Yea, my lord. I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	353	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And so she doth, cousin.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	354	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry “Heigh-ho for a husband!”
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	355	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	356	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	I would rather have one of your father’s getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	357	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Will you have me, lady?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	358	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days. Your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But I beseech your Grace pardon me. I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	359	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you, for out o’ question you were born in a merry hour.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	360	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born.—Cousins, God give you joy!
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	361	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	364	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	365	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	366	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	367	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	O, by no means. She mocks all her wooers out of suit.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	368	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	She were an excellent wife for Benedick.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	369	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	370	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	371	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	372	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just sevennight, and a time too brief, too, to have all things answer my mind.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	374	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules’ labors, which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection, th’ one with th’ other. I would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	375	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’ watchings.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	376	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And I, my lord.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	377	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	And you too, gentle Hero?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	378	speech	prose	Hero_Ado	I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	1	379	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humor your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick.— And I, with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	383	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	384	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med’cinable to me. I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	385	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	386	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Show me briefly how.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	387	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	I think I told your Lordship a year since, how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	389	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	390	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	391	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned Claudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold up, to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	392	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	What proof shall I make of that?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	393	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	394	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Only to despite them I will endeavor anything.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	395	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone. Tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret “Hero,” hear Margaret term me “Claudio,” and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent, and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	396	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	2	397	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	408	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love—and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	468	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	469	direction	delivery	Benedick_Ado	, aside
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	470	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Is ’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	471	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged affection, it is past the infinite of thought.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	472	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Maybe she doth but counterfeit.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	473	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Faith, like enough.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	474	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	475	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Why, what effects of passion shows she?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	476	direction	delivery	Claudio_Ado	, aside to Leonato
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	477	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	478	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	What effects, my lord? She will sit you—you heard my daughter tell you how.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	479	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	She did indeed.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	480	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	How, how I pray you? You amaze me. I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	481	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against Benedick.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	482	direction	delivery	Benedick_Ado	, aside
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	483	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it. Knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such reverence.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	484	direction	delivery	Claudio_Ado	, aside to Prince
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	485	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	He hath ta’en th’ infection. Hold it up.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	486	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	487	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	No, and swears she never will. That’s her torment.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	488	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	’Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. “Shall I,” says she, “that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him?”
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	489	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	This says she now when she is beginning to write to him, for she’ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us all.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	490	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	491	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	492	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	That.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	493	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her. “I measure him,” says she, “by my own spirit, for I should flout him if he writ to me, yea, though I love him, I should.”
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	494	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: “O sweet Benedick, God give me patience!”
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	495	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	496	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	497	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	498	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	499	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And she is exceeding wise.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	500	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	In everything but in loving Benedick.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	501	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	502	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	503	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Were it good, think you?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	504	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	505	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	506	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	He is a very proper man.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	507	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	508	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Before God, and in my mind, very wise.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	509	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	510	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And I take him to be valiant.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	511	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	512	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep peace. If he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	513	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	514	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Never tell him, my lord, let her wear it out with good counsel.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	515	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Nay, that’s impossible; she may wear her heart out first.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	516	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	517	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	518	direction	business	Leonato_Ado	Leonato, Prince, and Claudio begin to exit.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	521	direction	delivery	DonPedro_Ado	, aside to Leonato
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	522	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such matter. That’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	523	direction	exit	DonPedro_Ado	Prince, Leonato, and Claudio exit.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	523	direction	exit	Leonato_Ado	Prince, Leonato, and Claudio exit.

Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	524	direction	business	Benedick_Ado	, coming forward
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	525	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited! I hear how I am censured. They say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say, too, that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness. And virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot reprove it. And wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her! I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage, but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No! The world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	526	direction	entrance	Beatrice_Ado	Enter Beatrice.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	527	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Against my will, I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	528	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	529	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful, I would not have come.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	530	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	You take pleasure then in the message?
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	531	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior. Fare you well.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	532	direction	exit	Beatrice_Ado	She exits.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	533	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Ha! “Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that. “I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.” That’s as much as to say “Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.” If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
Much Ado About Nothing	2	3	534	direction	exit	Benedick_Ado	He exits.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	538	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	539	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	540	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	541	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	542	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower

Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	544	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	545	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	546	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	547	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	To listen our propose. This is thy office.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	548	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Bear thee well in it, and leave us alone.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	552	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	As we do trace this alley up and down,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	553	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Our talk must only be of Benedick.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	554	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	When I do name him, let it be thy part
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	555	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	To praise him more than ever man did merit.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	556	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	557	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	558	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	559	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	That only wounds by hearsay. Now begin,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	560	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	561	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Close by the ground, to hear our conference.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	566	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	567	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	568	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Is couchèd in the woodbine coverture.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	574	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	575	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	I know her spirits are as coy and wild
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	576	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	As haggards of the rock.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	577	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	But are you sure
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	578	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	579	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	So says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	580	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	581	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	582	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	583	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	To wish him wrestle with affection
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	584	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	And never to let Beatrice know of it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	585	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	586	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	587	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	588	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	O god of love! I know he doth deserve
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	589	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	As much as may be yielded to a man,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	590	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	But Nature never framed a woman’s heart
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	591	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	592	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	593	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Misprizing what they look on, and her wit
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	594	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Values itself so highly that to her
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	595	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	596	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	597	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	She is so self-endeared.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	598	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Sure, I think so,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	599	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	And therefore certainly it were not good
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	600	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	She knew his love, lest she’ll make sport at it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	601	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	602	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	603	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	But she would spell him backward. If fair-faced,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	604	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	605	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	606	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	607	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	If low, an agate very vilely cut;
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	608	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	609	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	If silent, why, a block moved with none.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	610	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	So turns she every man the wrong side out,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	611	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	And never gives to truth and virtue that
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	612	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	613	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	614	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	615	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	As Beatrice is cannot be commendable.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	616	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	617	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	She would mock me into air. O, she would laugh me
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	618	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	619	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	620	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	621	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	It were a better death than die with mocks,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	622	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	Which is as bad as die with tickling.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	623	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	624	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	No, rather I will go to Benedick
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	625	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	And counsel him to fight against his passion;
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	626	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	627	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	To stain my cousin with. One doth not know
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	628	speech	verse	Hero_Ado	How much an ill word may empoison liking.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	629	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	630	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	She cannot be so much without true judgment,
Much Ado About Nothing	3	1	631	speech	verse	Ursula_Ado	Having so swift and excellent a wit

Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	666	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Aragon.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	667	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe me.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	668	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	669	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Gallants, I am not as I have been.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	670	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	So say I. Methinks you are sadder.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	671	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	I hope he be in love.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	672	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Hang him, truant! There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	673	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	I have the toothache.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	674	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Draw it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	675	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Hang it!
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	676	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	677	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	What, sigh for the toothache?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	678	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Where is but a humor or a worm.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	679	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Well, everyone can master a grief but he that has it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	680	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Yet say I, he is in love.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	681	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	682	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs. He brushes his hat o’ mornings. What should that bode?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	683	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	684	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	685	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	686	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Nay, he rubs himself with civet. Can you smell him out by that?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	687	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in love.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	688	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	689	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	And when was he wont to wash his face?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	690	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear what they say of him.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	691	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops—
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	692	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, he is in love.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	693	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Nay, but I know who loves him.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	694	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	That would I know, too. I warrant, one that knows him not.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	695	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of all, dies for him.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	696	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	She shall be buried with her face upwards.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	697	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Yet is this no charm for the toothache.— Old signior, walk aside with me. I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	699	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	700	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	704	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	705	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	In private?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	706	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	707	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	What’s the matter?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	708	direction	delivery	DonJohn_Ado	, to Claudio
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	709	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Means your Lordship to be married tomorrow?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	710	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	You know he does.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	711	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	I know not that, when he knows what I know.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	712	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	713	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	You may think I love you not. Let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage—surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	714	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	Why, what’s the matter?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	715	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	716	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Who, Hero?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	717	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	718	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	Disloyal?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	719	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	The word is too good to paint out her wickedness. I could say she were worse. Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant. Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day. If you love her then, tomorrow wed her. But it would better fit your honor to change your mind.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	720	direction	delivery	Claudio_Ado	, to Prince
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	721	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	May this be so?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	722	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	I will not think it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	723	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I will show you enough, and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	724	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	725	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	726	speech	prose	DonJohn_Ado	I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses. Bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	727	speech	prose	DonPedro_Ado	O day untowardly turned!
Much Ado About Nothing	3	2	728	speech	prose	Claudio_Ado	O mischief strangely thwarting!

Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	733	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	734	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Nay, that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	735	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	736	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	737	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.1_Ado	Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal, for they can write and read.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	738	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Come hither, neighbor Seacoal.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	739	direction	business	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	Seacoal steps forward.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	740	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	God hath blessed you with a good name. To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	741	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	Both which, master constable—
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	742	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	743	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	How if he will not stand?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	744	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	745	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	746	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects.—You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	747	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.2_Ado	We will rather sleep than talk. We know what belongs to a watch.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	748	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	749	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	How if they will not?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	750	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Why then, let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	751	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	Well, sir.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	752	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man, and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	753	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	754	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Truly, by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	755	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	756	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	757	direction	delivery	Verges_Ado	, to the Watch
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	758	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	759	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.2_Ado	How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	760	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Why, then depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a calf when he bleats.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	761	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	’Tis very true.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	762	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	This is the end of the charge. You, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	763	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	Nay, by ’r Lady, that I think he cannot.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	764	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Five shillings to one on ’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him—marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	765	speech	prose	Verges_Ado	By ’r Lady, I think it be so.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	766	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	Ha, ah ha!—Well, masters, goodnight. An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and goodnight.—Come, neighbor.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	769	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight. Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	777	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab follow.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	778	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	I will owe thee an answer for that. And now forward with thy tale.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	779	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	781	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.Seacoal_Ado	Some treason, masters. Yet stand close.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	782	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Therefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	783	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	784	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich. For when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	785	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	I wonder at it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	786	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	787	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	Yes, it is apparel.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	788	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	I mean the fashion.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	789	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	790	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	791	direction	delivery	WATCHMEN.1_Ado	, aside
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	792	speech	prose	WATCHMEN.1_Ado	I know that Deformed. He has been a vile thief this seven year. He goes up and down like a gentleman. I remember his name.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	793	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Didst thou not hear somebody?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	794	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	No, ’twas the vane on the house.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	795	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is, how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty, sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting, sometimes like god Bel’s priests in the old church window, sometimes like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	796	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	797	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Not so, neither. But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero. She leans me out at her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand times goodnight. I tell this tale vilely. I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable amiable encounter.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	798	speech	prose	Conrade_Ado	And thought they Margaret was Hero?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	3	799	speech	prose	Borachio_Ado	Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged, swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o’ernight and send her home again without a husband.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	825	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	826	speech	prose	Hero_Ado	O, that exceeds, they say.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	827	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	By my troth, ’s but a nightgown in respect of yours—cloth o’ gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel. But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on ’t.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	828	speech	prose	Hero_Ado	God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	831	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	Of what, lady? Of speaking honorably? Is not marriage honorable in a beggar? Is not your lord honorable without marriage? I think you would have me say “Saving your reverence, a husband.” An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in “the heavier for a husband”? None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife. Otherwise, ’tis light and not heavy. Ask my lady Beatrice else. Here she comes.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	837	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	Clap ’s into “Light o’ love.” That goes without a burden. Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	838	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	You light o’ love with your heels! Then, if your husband have stables enough, you’ll see he shall lack no barns.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	839	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	O, illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	840	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	’Tis almost five o’clock, cousin. ’Tis time you were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill. Heigh-ho!

Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	850	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	851	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	It is not seen enough; you should wear it in your cap. By my troth, I am sick.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	852	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	Get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus and lay it to your heart. It is the only thing for a qualm.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	853	speech	prose	Hero_Ado	There thou prick’st her with a thistle.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	854	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	Benedictus! Why benedictus? You have some moral in this benedictus?
Much Ado About Nothing	3	4	855	speech	prose	Margaret_Ado	Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant plain holy thistle. You may think perchance that I think you are in love. Nay, by ’r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man. He swore he would never marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging. And how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.

Much Ado About Nothing	3	5	879	speech	prose	Dogberry_Ado	A good old man, sir. He will be talking. As they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God help us, it is a world to see!—Well said, i’ faith, neighbor Verges.—Well, God’s a good man. An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread, but God is to be worshiped, all men are not alike, alas, good neighbor.
Much Ado About Nothing	3	5	880	speech	prose	Leonato_Ado	Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.

Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1061	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,

Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1086	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	There is some strange misprision in the princes.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1087	speech	verse	Benedick_Ado	Two of them have the very bent of honor,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1088	speech	verse	Benedick_Ado	And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1089	speech	verse	Benedick_Ado	The practice of it lives in John the Bastard,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1090	speech	verse	Benedick_Ado	Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1091	speech	verse	Leonato_Ado	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,

Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1098	speech	verse	Leonato_Ado	But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1099	speech	verse	Leonato_Ado	Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1100	speech	verse	Leonato_Ado	Ability in means and choice of friends,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1101	speech	verse	Leonato_Ado	To quit me of them throughly.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1102	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Pause awhile,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1103	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	And let my counsel sway you in this case.

Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1105	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1106	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	And publish it that she is dead indeed.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1107	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Maintain a mourning ostentation,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1108	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	And on your family’s old monument
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1109	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1110	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	That appertain unto a burial.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1111	speech	verse	Leonato_Ado	What shall become of this? What will this do?
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1112	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1113	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Change slander to remorse. That is some good.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1114	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	But not for that dream I on this strange course,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1115	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	But on this travail look for greater birth.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1116	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	She, dying, as it must be so maintained,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1117	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Upon the instant that she was accused,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1118	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Shall be lamented, pitied, and excused
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1119	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Of every hearer. For it so falls out
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1120	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	That what we have we prize not to the worth
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1121	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Whiles we enjoy it, but being lacked and lost,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1122	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Why then we rack the value, then we find
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1123	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	The virtue that possession would not show us
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1124	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1125	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	When he shall hear she died upon his words,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1126	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Th’ idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1127	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Into his study of imagination,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1128	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	And every lovely organ of her life
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1129	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Shall come appareled in more precious habit,

Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1131	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1132	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Than when she lived indeed. Then shall he mourn,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1133	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	If ever love had interest in his liver,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1134	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	And wish he had not so accused her,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1135	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	No, though he thought his accusation true.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1136	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1137	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Will fashion the event in better shape
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1138	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1139	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	But if all aim but this be leveled false,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1140	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	The supposition of the lady’s death
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1141	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	Will quench the wonder of her infamy.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1142	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1143	speech	verse	FriarFrancis_Ado	As best befits her wounded reputation,

Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1170	speech	prose	Beatrice_Ado	As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you, but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.

Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones, too. He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing; therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
Much Ado About Nothing	4	1	1200	speech	prose	Benedick_Ado	Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.

Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to “lady” but “baby”—an innocent rhyme; for “scorn,” “horn”—a hard rhyme; for “school,” “fool”—a babbling rhyme; very ominous endings.
