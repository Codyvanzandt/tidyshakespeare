Hamlet	1	1	28	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
Hamlet	1	1	29	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	I have seen nothing.

Hamlet	1	1	42	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Well, sit we down,
Hamlet	1	1	43	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
Hamlet	1	1	44	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Last night of all,
Hamlet	1	1	45	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	When yond same star that’s westward from the pole
Hamlet	1	1	46	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven

Hamlet	1	1	54	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Looks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
Hamlet	1	1	55	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Hamlet	1	1	56	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	It would be spoke to.
Hamlet	1	1	57	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Speak to it, Horatio.
Hamlet	1	1	58	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,
Hamlet	1	1	59	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Together with that fair and warlike form
Hamlet	1	1	60	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Hamlet	1	1	61	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee, speak.

Hamlet	1	1	63	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	See, it stalks away.

Hamlet	1	1	66	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	’Tis gone and will not answer.
Hamlet	1	1	67	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.
Hamlet	1	1	68	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Is not this something more than fantasy?
Hamlet	1	1	69	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	What think you on ’t?
Hamlet	1	1	70	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Before my God, I might not this believe
Hamlet	1	1	71	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Without the sensible and true avouch
Hamlet	1	1	72	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Of mine own eyes.
Hamlet	1	1	73	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Is it not like the King?
Hamlet	1	1	74	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	As thou art to thyself.
Hamlet	1	1	75	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Such was the very armor he had on
Hamlet	1	1	76	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	When he the ambitious Norway combated.
Hamlet	1	1	77	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,
Hamlet	1	1	78	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Hamlet	1	1	79	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	’Tis strange.
Hamlet	1	1	80	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Hamlet	1	1	81	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Hamlet	1	1	82	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	In what particular thought to work I know not,
Hamlet	1	1	83	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	But in the gross and scope of mine opinion
Hamlet	1	1	84	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Hamlet	1	1	85	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Hamlet	1	1	86	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Why this same strict and most observant watch
Hamlet	1	1	87	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Hamlet	1	1	88	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
Hamlet	1	1	89	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	And foreign mart for implements of war,
Hamlet	1	1	90	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Hamlet	1	1	91	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
Hamlet	1	1	92	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	What might be toward that this sweaty haste
Hamlet	1	1	93	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?
Hamlet	1	1	94	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Who is ’t that can inform me?
Hamlet	1	1	95	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	That can I.
Hamlet	1	1	96	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	At least the whisper goes so: our last king,
Hamlet	1	1	97	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Whose image even but now appeared to us,
Hamlet	1	1	98	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Hamlet	1	1	99	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,
Hamlet	1	1	100	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Hamlet	1	1	101	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)
Hamlet	1	1	102	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,
Hamlet	1	1	103	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Hamlet	1	1	104	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Hamlet	1	1	105	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.
Hamlet	1	1	106	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Against the which a moiety competent
Hamlet	1	1	107	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Was gagèd by our king, which had returned
Hamlet	1	1	108	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Hamlet	1	1	109	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
Hamlet	1	1	110	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And carriage of the article designed,
Hamlet	1	1	111	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

Hamlet	1	1	113	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Hamlet	1	1	114	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes
Hamlet	1	1	115	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	For food and diet to some enterprise
Hamlet	1	1	116	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	That hath a stomach in ’t; which is no other
Hamlet	1	1	117	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	(As it doth well appear unto our state)
Hamlet	1	1	118	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	But to recover of us, by strong hand
Hamlet	1	1	119	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
Hamlet	1	1	120	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	So by his father lost. And this, I take it,
Hamlet	1	1	121	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Is the main motive of our preparations,
Hamlet	1	1	122	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Hamlet	1	1	123	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.
Hamlet	1	1	124	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	I think it be no other but e’en so.
Hamlet	1	1	125	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Hamlet	1	1	126	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Comes armèd through our watch so like the king
Hamlet	1	1	127	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	That was and is the question of these wars.
Hamlet	1	1	128	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.
Hamlet	1	1	129	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Hamlet	1	1	130	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Hamlet	1	1	131	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
Hamlet	1	1	132	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
Hamlet	1	1	133	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Hamlet	1	1	134	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
Hamlet	1	1	135	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,
Hamlet	1	1	136	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
Hamlet	1	1	137	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And even the like precurse of feared events,
Hamlet	1	1	138	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	As harbingers preceding still the fates

Hamlet	1	1	170	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	It was about to speak when the cock crew.
Hamlet	1	1	171	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And then it started like a guilty thing
Hamlet	1	1	172	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Hamlet	1	1	173	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Hamlet	1	1	174	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

Hamlet	1	2	252	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Hamlet	1	2	253	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
Hamlet	1	2	254	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	My dread lord,
Hamlet	1	2	255	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Your leave and favor to return to France,
Hamlet	1	2	256	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
Hamlet	1	2	257	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	To show my duty in your coronation,
Hamlet	1	2	258	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
Hamlet	1	2	259	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Hamlet	1	2	260	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
Hamlet	1	2	261	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?
Hamlet	1	2	262	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Hamlet	1	2	263	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	By laborsome petition, and at last
Hamlet	1	2	264	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Upon his will I sealed my hard consent.
Hamlet	1	2	265	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	I do beseech you give him leave to go.
Hamlet	1	2	266	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
Hamlet	1	2	267	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And thy best graces spend it at thy will.—
Hamlet	1	2	268	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son—
Hamlet	1	2	269	direction	delivery	Hamlet_Ham	, aside
Hamlet	1	2	270	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	A little more than kin and less than kind.
Hamlet	1	2	271	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Hamlet	1	2	272	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Not so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.
Hamlet	1	2	273	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,
Hamlet	1	2	274	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Hamlet	1	2	275	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Do not forever with thy vailèd lids
Hamlet	1	2	276	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Hamlet	1	2	277	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die,
Hamlet	1	2	278	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Passing through nature to eternity.
Hamlet	1	2	279	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Ay, madam, it is common.
Hamlet	1	2	280	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	If it be,
Hamlet	1	2	281	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Why seems it so particular with thee?
Hamlet	1	2	282	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	“Seems,” madam? Nay, it is. I know not “seems.”
Hamlet	1	2	283	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Hamlet	1	2	284	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Hamlet	1	2	285	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Hamlet	1	2	286	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Hamlet	1	2	287	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
Hamlet	1	2	288	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Hamlet	1	2	289	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	That can denote me truly. These indeed “seem,”
Hamlet	1	2	290	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	For they are actions that a man might play;
Hamlet	1	2	291	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But I have that within which passes show,
Hamlet	1	2	292	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
Hamlet	1	2	293	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Hamlet	1	2	294	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	To give these mourning duties to your father.
Hamlet	1	2	295	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	But you must know your father lost a father,
Hamlet	1	2	296	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
Hamlet	1	2	297	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	In filial obligation for some term
Hamlet	1	2	298	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
Hamlet	1	2	299	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	In obstinate condolement is a course
Hamlet	1	2	300	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief.
Hamlet	1	2	301	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Hamlet	1	2	302	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Hamlet	1	2	303	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	An understanding simple and unschooled.
Hamlet	1	2	304	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	For what we know must be and is as common
Hamlet	1	2	305	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Hamlet	1	2	306	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Why should we in our peevish opposition
Hamlet	1	2	307	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,
Hamlet	1	2	308	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
Hamlet	1	2	309	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	To reason most absurd, whose common theme
Hamlet	1	2	310	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Hamlet	1	2	311	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	From the first corse till he that died today,
Hamlet	1	2	312	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	“This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth
Hamlet	1	2	313	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	This unprevailing woe and think of us
Hamlet	1	2	314	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	As of a father; for let the world take note,
Hamlet	1	2	315	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	You are the most immediate to our throne,
Hamlet	1	2	316	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And with no less nobility of love
Hamlet	1	2	317	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Than that which dearest father bears his son
Hamlet	1	2	318	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Hamlet	1	2	319	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	In going back to school in Wittenberg,
Hamlet	1	2	320	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	It is most retrograde to our desire,
Hamlet	1	2	321	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Hamlet	1	2	322	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Hamlet	1	2	323	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Hamlet	1	2	324	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Hamlet	1	2	325	speech	verse	Gertrude_Ham	I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.
Hamlet	1	2	326	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Hamlet	1	2	327	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.
Hamlet	1	2	328	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come.
Hamlet	1	2	329	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Hamlet	1	2	330	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof

Hamlet	1	2	366	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	It is not, nor it cannot come to good.

Hamlet	1	2	371	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Horatio—or I do forget myself!
Hamlet	1	2	372	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Hamlet	1	2	373	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Sir, my good friend. I’ll change that name with you.
Hamlet	1	2	374	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—
Hamlet	1	2	375	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Marcellus?
Hamlet	1	2	376	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	My good lord.
Hamlet	1	2	377	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.—
Hamlet	1	2	378	direction	delivery	Hamlet_Ham	To Barnardo.
Hamlet	1	2	379	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Hamlet	1	2	380	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	A truant disposition, good my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	381	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I would not hear your enemy say so,
Hamlet	1	2	382	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Nor shall you do my ear that violence
Hamlet	1	2	383	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	To make it truster of your own report
Hamlet	1	2	384	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
Hamlet	1	2	385	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Hamlet	1	2	386	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Hamlet	1	2	387	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
Hamlet	1	2	388	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.
Hamlet	1	2	389	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
Hamlet	1	2	390	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Hamlet	1	2	391	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Thrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats
Hamlet	1	2	392	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Hamlet	1	2	393	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Hamlet	1	2	394	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Hamlet	1	2	395	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	My father—methinks I see my father.
Hamlet	1	2	396	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Where, my lord?
Hamlet	1	2	397	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
Hamlet	1	2	398	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
Hamlet	1	2	399	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	He was a man. Take him for all in all,
Hamlet	1	2	400	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I shall not look upon his like again.
Hamlet	1	2	401	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Hamlet	1	2	402	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Saw who?
Hamlet	1	2	403	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	My lord, the King your father.
Hamlet	1	2	404	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	The King my father?
Hamlet	1	2	405	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Season your admiration for a while
Hamlet	1	2	406	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	With an attent ear, till I may deliver
Hamlet	1	2	407	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Upon the witness of these gentlemen
Hamlet	1	2	408	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	This marvel to you.
Hamlet	1	2	409	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	For God’s love, let me hear!
Hamlet	1	2	410	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Hamlet	1	2	411	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,
Hamlet	1	2	412	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	In the dead waste and middle of the night,
Hamlet	1	2	413	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Been thus encountered: a figure like your father,
Hamlet	1	2	414	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,
Hamlet	1	2	415	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Appears before them and with solemn march
Hamlet	1	2	416	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked
Hamlet	1	2	417	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes
Hamlet	1	2	418	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled
Hamlet	1	2	419	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Hamlet	1	2	420	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Hamlet	1	2	421	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
Hamlet	1	2	422	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And I with them the third night kept the watch,
Hamlet	1	2	423	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Where, as they had delivered, both in time,
Hamlet	1	2	424	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Form of the thing (each word made true and good),
Hamlet	1	2	425	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	The apparition comes. I knew your father;
Hamlet	1	2	426	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	These hands are not more like.
Hamlet	1	2	427	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But where was this?
Hamlet	1	2	428	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
Hamlet	1	2	429	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Did you not speak to it?
Hamlet	1	2	430	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	My lord, I did,
Hamlet	1	2	431	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	But answer made it none. Yet once methought
Hamlet	1	2	432	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	It lifted up its head and did address
Hamlet	1	2	433	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Hamlet	1	2	434	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Hamlet	1	2	435	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
Hamlet	1	2	436	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And vanished from our sight.
Hamlet	1	2	437	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	’Tis very strange.
Hamlet	1	2	438	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.
Hamlet	1	2	439	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	And we did think it writ down in our duty
Hamlet	1	2	440	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	To let you know of it.
Hamlet	1	2	441	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hamlet	1	2	442	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Hold you the watch tonight?
Hamlet	1	2	443	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	We do, my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	443	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	We do, my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	443	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	We do, my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	444	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Armed, say you?
Hamlet	1	2	445	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Armed, my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	445	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Armed, my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	445	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Armed, my lord.
Hamlet	1	2	446	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	From top to toe?
Hamlet	1	2	447	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	My lord, from head to foot.
Hamlet	1	2	447	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	My lord, from head to foot.
Hamlet	1	2	447	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	My lord, from head to foot.
Hamlet	1	2	448	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Then saw you not his face?
Hamlet	1	2	449	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
Hamlet	1	2	450	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	What, looked he frowningly?
Hamlet	1	2	451	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Hamlet	1	2	452	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Pale or red?
Hamlet	1	2	453	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Nay, very pale.
Hamlet	1	2	454	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And fixed his eyes upon you?
Hamlet	1	2	455	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Most constantly.
Hamlet	1	2	456	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I would I had been there.
Hamlet	1	2	457	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	It would have much amazed you.
Hamlet	1	2	458	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Very like. Stayed it long?
Hamlet	1	2	459	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Hamlet	1	2	460	speech	verse	Barnardo_Ham	Longer, longer.
Hamlet	1	2	460	speech	verse	Marcellus_Ham	Longer, longer.
Hamlet	1	2	461	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Not when I saw ’t.
Hamlet	1	2	462	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	His beard was grizzled, no?
Hamlet	1	2	463	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	It was as I have seen it in his life,
Hamlet	1	2	464	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	A sable silvered.
Hamlet	1	2	465	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I will watch tonight.
Hamlet	1	2	466	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Perchance ’twill walk again.
Hamlet	1	2	467	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	I warrant it will.
Hamlet	1	2	468	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	If it assume my noble father’s person,
Hamlet	1	2	469	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
Hamlet	1	2	470	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
Hamlet	1	2	471	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
Hamlet	1	2	472	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Hamlet	1	2	473	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And whatsomever else shall hap tonight,
Hamlet	1	2	474	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Give it an understanding but no tongue.
Hamlet	1	2	475	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I will requite your loves. So fare you well.
Hamlet	1	2	476	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,
Hamlet	1	2	477	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I’ll visit you.

Hamlet	1	3	504	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Hamlet	1	3	505	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
Hamlet	1	3	506	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,
Hamlet	1	3	507	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	For he himself is subject to his birth.
Hamlet	1	3	508	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Hamlet	1	3	509	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
Hamlet	1	3	510	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	The safety and the health of this whole state.
Hamlet	1	3	511	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Hamlet	1	3	512	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Hamlet	1	3	513	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Whereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves you,
Hamlet	1	3	514	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
Hamlet	1	3	515	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	As he in his particular act and place
Hamlet	1	3	516	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	May give his saying deed, which is no further
Hamlet	1	3	517	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Hamlet	1	3	518	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain
Hamlet	1	3	519	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	If with too credent ear you list his songs
Hamlet	1	3	520	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open

Hamlet	1	3	522	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Fear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,
Hamlet	1	3	523	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Hamlet	1	3	524	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Hamlet	1	3	525	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	The chariest maid is prodigal enough
Hamlet	1	3	526	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	If she unmask her beauty to the moon.

Hamlet	1	3	549	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And these few precepts in thy memory
Hamlet	1	3	550	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Hamlet	1	3	551	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Hamlet	1	3	552	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Hamlet	1	3	553	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Hamlet	1	3	554	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,
Hamlet	1	3	555	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Hamlet	1	3	556	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Of each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware
Hamlet	1	3	557	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,
Hamlet	1	3	558	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Bear ’t that th’ opposèd may beware of thee.
Hamlet	1	3	559	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.
Hamlet	1	3	560	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Hamlet	1	3	561	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Hamlet	1	3	562	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	But not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),
Hamlet	1	3	563	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Hamlet	1	3	564	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And they in France of the best rank and station
Hamlet	1	3	565	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Hamlet	1	3	566	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
Hamlet	1	3	567	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
Hamlet	1	3	568	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
Hamlet	1	3	569	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	This above all: to thine own self be true,
Hamlet	1	3	570	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And it must follow, as the night the day,
Hamlet	1	3	571	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Thou canst not then be false to any man.

Hamlet	1	3	592	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders

Hamlet	1	3	596	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Do you believe his “tenders,” as you call them?
Hamlet	1	3	597	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Hamlet	1	3	598	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Marry, I will teach you. Think yourself a baby
Hamlet	1	3	599	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,
Hamlet	1	3	600	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
Hamlet	1	3	601	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Hamlet	1	3	602	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Running it thus) you’ll tender me a fool.
Hamlet	1	3	603	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	My lord, he hath importuned me with love

Hamlet	1	3	605	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Ay, “fashion” you may call it. Go to, go to!

Hamlet	1	3	607	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Hamlet	1	3	608	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Hamlet	1	3	609	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Hamlet	1	3	610	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,

Hamlet	1	3	612	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Even in their promise as it is a-making,
Hamlet	1	3	613	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	You must not take for fire. From this time
Hamlet	1	3	614	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
Hamlet	1	3	615	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Hamlet	1	3	616	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,
Hamlet	1	3	617	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Believe so much in him that he is young,
Hamlet	1	3	618	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And with a larger tether may he walk
Hamlet	1	3	619	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
Hamlet	1	3	620	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,
Hamlet	1	3	621	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Not of that dye which their investments show,

Hamlet	1	5	768	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Murder?
Hamlet	1	5	769	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Murder most foul, as in the best it is,

Hamlet	1	5	771	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift
Hamlet	1	5	772	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	As meditation or the thoughts of love,

Hamlet	1	5	774	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	I find thee apt;

Hamlet	1	5	776	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Hamlet	1	5	777	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
Hamlet	1	5	778	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
Hamlet	1	5	779	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
Hamlet	1	5	780	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Is by a forgèd process of my death
Hamlet	1	5	781	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,
Hamlet	1	5	782	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	The serpent that did sting thy father’s life
Hamlet	1	5	783	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Now wears his crown.
Hamlet	1	5	784	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Hamlet	1	5	785	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Hamlet	1	5	786	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts—
Hamlet	1	5	787	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
Hamlet	1	5	788	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
Hamlet	1	5	789	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
Hamlet	1	5	790	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!
Hamlet	1	5	791	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	From me, whose love was of that dignity
Hamlet	1	5	792	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
Hamlet	1	5	793	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Hamlet	1	5	794	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Hamlet	1	5	795	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	To those of mine.
Hamlet	1	5	796	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Hamlet	1	5	797	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
Hamlet	1	5	798	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,
Hamlet	1	5	799	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Will sate itself in a celestial bed
Hamlet	1	5	800	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	And prey on garbage.
Hamlet	1	5	801	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.
Hamlet	1	5	802	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Hamlet	1	5	803	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	My custom always of the afternoon,
Hamlet	1	5	804	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
Hamlet	1	5	805	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	With juice of cursèd hebona in a vial
Hamlet	1	5	806	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	And in the porches of my ears did pour
Hamlet	1	5	807	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	The leprous distilment, whose effect
Hamlet	1	5	808	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Hamlet	1	5	809	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
Hamlet	1	5	810	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
Hamlet	1	5	811	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	And with a sudden vigor it doth posset
Hamlet	1	5	812	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
Hamlet	1	5	813	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,
Hamlet	1	5	814	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	And a most instant tetter barked about,
Hamlet	1	5	815	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
Hamlet	1	5	816	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	All my smooth body.
Hamlet	1	5	817	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand
Hamlet	1	5	818	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,
Hamlet	1	5	819	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,
Hamlet	1	5	820	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,
Hamlet	1	5	821	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	No reck’ning made, but sent to my account
Hamlet	1	5	822	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	With all my imperfections on my head.
Hamlet	1	5	823	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!
Hamlet	1	5	824	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Hamlet	1	5	825	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Hamlet	1	5	826	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.
Hamlet	1	5	827	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	But, howsomever thou pursues this act,
Hamlet	1	5	828	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Hamlet	1	5	829	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven
Hamlet	1	5	830	speech	verse	Ghost_Ham	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge

Hamlet	2	1	962	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,

Hamlet	2	1	1034	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	With what, i’ th’ name of God?
Hamlet	2	1	1035	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Hamlet	2	1	1036	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,
Hamlet	2	1	1037	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,
Hamlet	2	1	1038	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle,
Hamlet	2	1	1039	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
Hamlet	2	1	1040	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	And with a look so piteous in purport

Hamlet	2	1	1046	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	What said he?
Hamlet	2	1	1047	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	He took me by the wrist and held me hard.
Hamlet	2	1	1048	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
Hamlet	2	1	1049	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,
Hamlet	2	1	1050	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	He falls to such perusal of my face
Hamlet	2	1	1051	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	As he would draw it. Long stayed he so.

Hamlet	2	1	1053	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
Hamlet	2	1	1054	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
Hamlet	2	1	1055	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
Hamlet	2	1	1056	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
Hamlet	2	1	1057	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	And, with his head over his shoulder turned,
Hamlet	2	1	1058	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	He seemed to find his way without his eyes,
Hamlet	2	1	1059	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	For out o’ doors he went without their helps

Hamlet	2	1	1061	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
Hamlet	2	1	1062	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	This is the very ecstasy of love,
Hamlet	2	1	1063	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	Whose violent property fordoes itself
Hamlet	2	1	1064	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And leads the will to desperate undertakings
Hamlet	2	1	1065	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	As oft as any passions under heaven
Hamlet	2	1	1066	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
Hamlet	2	1	1067	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	What, have you given him any hard words of late?
Hamlet	2	1	1068	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	No, my good lord, but as you did command
Hamlet	2	1	1069	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	I did repel his letters and denied
Hamlet	2	1	1070	speech	verse	Ophelia_Ham	His access to me.
Hamlet	2	1	1071	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	That hath made him mad.
Hamlet	2	1	1072	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
Hamlet	2	1	1073	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	I had not coted him. I feared he did but trifle
Hamlet	2	1	1074	speech	verse	Polonius_Ham	And meant to wrack thee. But beshrew my jealousy!

Hamlet	2	2	1277	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	Do you know me, my lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1278	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
Hamlet	2	2	1279	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	Not I, my lord.
Hamlet	2	2	1280	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Then I would you were so honest a man.
Hamlet	2	2	1281	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	Honest, my lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1282	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
Hamlet	2	2	1283	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	That’s very true, my lord.
Hamlet	2	2	1284	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion—Have you a daughter?

Hamlet	2	2	1289	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Words, words, words.

Hamlet	2	2	1292	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
Hamlet	2	2	1293	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.

Hamlet	2	2	1297	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	Indeed, that’s out of the air. How pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.—My lord, I will take my leave of you.
Hamlet	2	2	1298	direction	delivery	Polonius_Ham	Aside.

Hamlet	2	2	1320	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?
Hamlet	2	2	1321	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	Prison, my lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1322	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Denmark’s a prison.
Hamlet	2	2	1323	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Then is the world one.
Hamlet	2	2	1324	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.
Hamlet	2	2	1325	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	We think not so, my lord.
Hamlet	2	2	1326	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me, it is a prison.
Hamlet	2	2	1327	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Why, then, your ambition makes it one. ’Tis too narrow for your mind.
Hamlet	2	2	1328	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
Hamlet	2	2	1329	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	Which dreams, indeed, are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
Hamlet	2	2	1330	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	A dream itself is but a shadow.
Hamlet	2	2	1331	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
Hamlet	2	2	1332	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason.
Hamlet	2	2	1333	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	We’ll wait upon you.
Hamlet	2	2	1333	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	We’ll wait upon you.
Hamlet	2	2	1334	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
Hamlet	2	2	1335	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
Hamlet	2	2	1336	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.
Hamlet	2	2	1337	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	What should we say, my lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1338	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Anything but to th’ purpose. You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color. I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
Hamlet	2	2	1339	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	To what end, my lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1340	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal: be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no.

Hamlet	2	2	1344	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Nay, then, I have an eye of you.—If you love me, hold not off.
Hamlet	2	2	1345	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	My lord, we were sent for.
Hamlet	2	2	1346	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the Earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof, fretted with golden fire—why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable; in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me, no, nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
Hamlet	2	2	1347	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Hamlet	2	2	1348	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Why did you laugh, then, when I said “man delights not me”?
Hamlet	2	2	1349	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
Hamlet	2	2	1350	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	He that plays the king shall be welcome—his Majesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t. What players are they?
Hamlet	2	2	1351	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.
Hamlet	2	2	1352	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
Hamlet	2	2	1353	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
Hamlet	2	2	1354	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
Hamlet	2	2	1355	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	No, indeed are they not.
Hamlet	2	2	1356	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
Hamlet	2	2	1357	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t. These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.
Hamlet	2	2	1358	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
Hamlet	2	2	1359	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
Hamlet	2	2	1360	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Is ’t possible?
Hamlet	2	2	1361	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Hamlet	2	2	1362	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Do the boys carry it away?
Hamlet	2	2	1363	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Ay, that they do, my lord—Hercules and his load too.
Hamlet	2	2	1364	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Hamlet	2	2	1365	direction	sound		A flourish for the Players.

Hamlet	2	2	1367	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then. Th’ appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
Hamlet	2	2	1368	speech	prose	Guildenstern_Ham	In what, my dear lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1369	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.

Hamlet	2	2	1373	speech	prose	Rosencrantz_Ham	Haply he is the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
Hamlet	2	2	1374	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.—You say right, sir, a Monday morning, ’twas then indeed.
Hamlet	2	2	1375	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	My lord, I have news to tell you.
Hamlet	2	2	1376	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius was an actor in Rome—
Hamlet	2	2	1377	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	The actors are come hither, my lord.
Hamlet	2	2	1378	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Buzz, buzz.
Hamlet	2	2	1379	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	Upon my honor—
Hamlet	2	2	1380	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Then came each actor on his ass.
Hamlet	2	2	1381	speech	prose	Polonius_Ham	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.

Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark?—What, my young lady and mistress! By ’r Lady, your Ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to ’t like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
Hamlet	2	2	1400	speech	prose	PLAYERS.1_Ham	What speech, my good lord?
Hamlet	2	2	1401	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million: ’twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I received it, and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much, more handsome than fine. One speech in ’t I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line—let me see, let me see:
Hamlet	2	2	1402	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast—
Hamlet	2	2	1403	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	’tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

Hamlet	2	2	1412	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	That lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light

Hamlet	2	2	1527	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Have, by the very cunning of the scene,

Hamlet	2	2	1529	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	They have proclaimed their malefactions;
Hamlet	2	2	1530	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
Hamlet	2	2	1531	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players
Hamlet	2	2	1532	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Play something like the murder of my father
Hamlet	2	2	1533	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;
Hamlet	2	2	1534	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,
Hamlet	2	2	1535	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
Hamlet	2	2	1536	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	May be a devil, and the devil hath power
Hamlet	2	2	1537	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	T’ assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,

Hamlet	2	2	1539	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	As he is very potent with such spirits,
Hamlet	2	2	1540	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds

Hamlet	3	1	1623	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,

Hamlet	3	1	1626	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

Hamlet	3	1	1633	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Hamlet	3	1	1634	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But that the dread of something after death,
Hamlet	3	1	1635	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	The undiscovered country from whose bourn
Hamlet	3	1	1636	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	No traveler returns, puzzles the will
Hamlet	3	1	1637	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Hamlet	3	1	1638	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Than fly to others that we know not of?
Hamlet	3	1	1639	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
Hamlet	3	1	1640	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And thus the native hue of resolution
Hamlet	3	1	1641	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,

Hamlet	3	1	1665	speech	prose	Ophelia_Ham	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Hamlet	3	1	1666	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
Hamlet	3	1	1667	speech	prose	Ophelia_Ham	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Hamlet	3	1	1668	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	You should not have believed me, for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.

Hamlet	3	1	1670	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?

Get thee to a nunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.

Hamlet	3	1	1676	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and you lisp; you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on ’t. It hath made me mad. I say we will have no more marriage.

Hamlet	3	2	1721	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious, periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it.
Hamlet	3	2	1722	speech	prose	PLAYERS.0.1_Ham	I warrant your Honor.
Hamlet	3	2	1723	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theater of others. O, there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise (and that highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
Hamlet	3	2	1724	speech	prose	PLAYERS.0.1_Ham	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
Hamlet	3	2	1725	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.

You would play upon me, you would seem to know my stops, you would pluck out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am.

Hamlet	4	7	2874	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,
Hamlet	4	7	2875	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	But yet to me they’re strong. The Queen his mother

Hamlet	4	7	2877	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),
Hamlet	4	7	2878	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	She is so conjunctive to my life and soul
Hamlet	4	7	2879	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
Hamlet	4	7	2880	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	I could not but by her. The other motive
Hamlet	4	7	2881	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Why to a public count I might not go
Hamlet	4	7	2882	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Is the great love the general gender bear him,

Hamlet	4	7	2941	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts
Hamlet	4	7	2942	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Did not together pluck such envy from him
Hamlet	4	7	2943	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	As did that one, and that, in my regard,

Hamlet	4	7	2945	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	What part is that, my lord?
Hamlet	4	7	2946	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	A very ribbon in the cap of youth—

Hamlet	4	7	2952	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	I have seen myself, and served against, the French,
Hamlet	4	7	2953	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And they can well on horseback, but this gallant
Hamlet	4	7	2954	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Had witchcraft in ’t. He grew unto his seat,

Hamlet	4	7	2956	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured
Hamlet	4	7	2957	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought

Hamlet	4	7	2963	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	The very same.
Hamlet	4	7	2964	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	I know him well. He is the brooch indeed
Hamlet	4	7	2965	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And gem of all the nation.
Hamlet	4	7	2966	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	He made confession of you

Hamlet	4	7	2972	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
Hamlet	4	7	2973	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Hamlet	4	7	2974	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
Hamlet	4	7	2975	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	That he could nothing do but wish and beg

Hamlet	4	7	2979	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Hamlet	4	7	2980	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
Hamlet	4	7	2981	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	A face without a heart?
Hamlet	4	7	2982	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Why ask you this?
Hamlet	4	7	2983	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Not that I think you did not love your father,
Hamlet	4	7	2984	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	But that I know love is begun by time
Hamlet	4	7	2985	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And that I see, in passages of proof,
Hamlet	4	7	2986	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
Hamlet	4	7	2987	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	There lives within the very flame of love
Hamlet	4	7	2988	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,
Hamlet	4	7	2989	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And nothing is at a like goodness still;
Hamlet	4	7	2990	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,
Hamlet	4	7	2991	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Dies in his own too-much. That we would do
Hamlet	4	7	2992	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	We should do when we would; for this “would” changes
Hamlet	4	7	2993	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And hath abatements and delays as many
Hamlet	4	7	2994	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
Hamlet	4	7	2995	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh,

Hamlet	4	7	2998	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	To show yourself indeed your father’s son
Hamlet	4	7	2999	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	More than in words?

Hamlet	4	7	3001	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	No place indeed should murder sanctuarize;

Hamlet	4	7	3013	speech	verse	Claudius_Ham	Requite him for your father.
Hamlet	4	7	3014	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	I will do ’t,
Hamlet	4	7	3015	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.
Hamlet	4	7	3016	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	I bought an unction of a mountebank
Hamlet	4	7	3017	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,

Hamlet	4	7	3064	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet
Hamlet	4	7	3065	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Hamlet	4	7	3066	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
Hamlet	4	7	3067	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	The woman will be out.—Adieu, my lord.
Hamlet	4	7	3068	speech	verse	Laertes_Ham	I have a speech o’ fire that fain would blaze,

Hamlet	5	1	3077	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she willfully seeks her own salvation?
Hamlet	5	1	3078	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial.
Hamlet	5	1	3079	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?
Hamlet	5	1	3080	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	Why, ’tis found so.
Hamlet	5	1	3081	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three branches—it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
Hamlet	5	1	3082	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver—
Hamlet	5	1	3083	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he) he goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Hamlet	5	1	3084	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	But is this law?
Hamlet	5	1	3085	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Ay, marry, is ’t—crowner’s ’quest law.
Hamlet	5	1	3086	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.
Hamlet	5	1	3087	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Why, there thou sayst. And the more pity that great folk should have count’nance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gard’ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They hold up Adam’s profession.
Hamlet	5	1	3088	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	Was he a gentleman?
Hamlet	5	1	3089	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	He was the first that ever bore arms.
Hamlet	5	1	3090	speech	prose	GravediggersCompanion_Ham	Why, he had none.
Hamlet	5	1	3091	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the scripture? The scripture says Adam digged. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—

Hamlet	5	1	3095	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well. But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come.

This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God, might it not?

Hamlet	5	1	3129	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box, and must th’ inheritor himself have no more, ha?

Hamlet	5	1	3140	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

Hamlet	5	1	3148	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of it: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been grave-maker?
Hamlet	5	1	3149	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
Hamlet	5	1	3150	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	How long is that since?
Hamlet	5	1	3151	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet was born—he that is mad, and sent into England.
Hamlet	5	1	3152	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Hamlet	5	1	3153	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Why, because he was mad. He shall recover his wits there. Or if he do not, ’tis no great matter there.
Hamlet	5	1	3154	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Why?
Hamlet	5	1	3155	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	’Twill not be seen in him there. There the men are as mad as he.

Hamlet	5	1	3160	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Upon what ground?
Hamlet	5	1	3161	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
Hamlet	5	1	3162	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	How long will a man lie i’ th’ earth ere he rot?
Hamlet	5	1	3163	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Faith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in), he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.
Hamlet	5	1	3164	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Why he more than another?
Hamlet	5	1	3165	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now hath lien you i’ th’ earth three-and-twenty years.
Hamlet	5	1	3166	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Whose was it?
Hamlet	5	1	3167	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	A whoreson mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?

Hamlet	5	1	3169	speech	prose	Gravedigger_Ham	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.

Hamlet	5	1	3173	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Let me see. Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio—a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his back a thousand times, and now how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your own grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
Hamlet	5	1	3174	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	What’s that, my lord?
Hamlet	5	1	3175	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’ earth?

Hamlet	5	1	3179	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	E’en so, my lord.
Hamlet	5	1	3180	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
Hamlet	5	1	3181	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
Hamlet	5	1	3182	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither, with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel?
Hamlet	5	1	3183	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,

Hamlet	5	2	3296	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Remember it, my lord!
Hamlet	5	2	3297	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
Hamlet	5	2	3298	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Hamlet	5	2	3299	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—
Hamlet	5	2	3300	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And praised be rashness for it; let us know,
Hamlet	5	2	3301	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
Hamlet	5	2	3302	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us

Hamlet	5	2	3304	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Rough-hew them how we will—
Hamlet	5	2	3305	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	That is most certain.
Hamlet	5	2	3306	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Up from my cabin,
Hamlet	5	2	3307	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark
Hamlet	5	2	3308	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Groped I to find out them; had my desire,
Hamlet	5	2	3309	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew
Hamlet	5	2	3310	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	To mine own room again, making so bold
Hamlet	5	2	3311	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold
Hamlet	5	2	3312	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
Hamlet	5	2	3313	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	A royal knavery—an exact command,
Hamlet	5	2	3314	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Hamlet	5	2	3315	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too,
Hamlet	5	2	3316	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	With—ho!—such bugs and goblins in my life,
Hamlet	5	2	3317	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	That on the supervise, no leisure bated,
Hamlet	5	2	3318	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	No, not to stay the grinding of the ax,
Hamlet	5	2	3319	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	My head should be struck off.
Hamlet	5	2	3320	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Is ’t possible?

Hamlet	5	2	3323	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?
Hamlet	5	2	3324	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	I beseech you.
Hamlet	5	2	3325	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Being thus benetted round with villainies,
Hamlet	5	2	3326	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
Hamlet	5	2	3327	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	They had begun the play. I sat me down,
Hamlet	5	2	3328	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Devised a new commission, wrote it fair—
Hamlet	5	2	3329	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I once did hold it, as our statists do,
Hamlet	5	2	3330	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	A baseness to write fair, and labored much
Hamlet	5	2	3331	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
Hamlet	5	2	3332	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know
Hamlet	5	2	3333	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Th’ effect of what I wrote?
Hamlet	5	2	3334	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Ay, good my lord.
Hamlet	5	2	3335	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	An earnest conjuration from the King,
Hamlet	5	2	3336	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	As England was his faithful tributary,
Hamlet	5	2	3337	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	As love between them like the palm might flourish,
Hamlet	5	2	3338	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
Hamlet	5	2	3339	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And stand a comma ’tween their amities,
Hamlet	5	2	3340	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And many suchlike  of great charge,
Hamlet	5	2	3341	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Hamlet	5	2	3342	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Without debatement further, more or less,
Hamlet	5	2	3343	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	He should those bearers put to sudden death,
Hamlet	5	2	3344	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Not shriving time allowed.
Hamlet	5	2	3345	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	How was this sealed?
Hamlet	5	2	3346	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Hamlet	5	2	3347	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	I had my father’s signet in my purse,
Hamlet	5	2	3348	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Hamlet	5	2	3349	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other,
Hamlet	5	2	3350	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Subscribed it, gave ’t th’ impression, placed it safely,
Hamlet	5	2	3351	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Hamlet	5	2	3352	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Hamlet	5	2	3353	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Thou knowest already.
Hamlet	5	2	3354	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.
Hamlet	5	2	3355	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
Hamlet	5	2	3356	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	They are not near my conscience. Their defeat
Hamlet	5	2	3357	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Does by their own insinuation grow.
Hamlet	5	2	3358	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Hamlet	5	2	3359	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Between the pass and fell incensèd points
Hamlet	5	2	3360	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Of mighty opposites.
Hamlet	5	2	3361	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	Why, what a king is this!
Hamlet	5	2	3362	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon—
Hamlet	5	2	3363	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,
Hamlet	5	2	3364	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Popped in between th’ election and my hopes,
Hamlet	5	2	3365	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
Hamlet	5	2	3366	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And with such cozenage—is ’t not perfect conscience
Hamlet	5	2	3367	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	To quit him with this arm? And is ’t not to be damned
Hamlet	5	2	3368	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	To let this canker of our nature come
Hamlet	5	2	3369	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	In further evil?
Hamlet	5	2	3370	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	It must be shortly known to him from England
Hamlet	5	2	3371	speech	verse	Horatio_Ham	What is the issue of the business there.
Hamlet	5	2	3372	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	It will be short. The interim’s mine,
Hamlet	5	2	3373	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	And a man’s life’s no more than to say “one.”
Hamlet	5	2	3374	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
Hamlet	5	2	3375	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	That to Laertes I forgot myself,
Hamlet	5	2	3376	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	For by the image of my cause I see
Hamlet	5	2	3377	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favors.
Hamlet	5	2	3378	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Hamlet	5	2	3379	speech	verse	Hamlet_Ham	Into a tow’ring passion.

Hamlet	5	2	3389	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Thy state is the more gracious, for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess. ’Tis a chough, but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
Hamlet	5	2	3390	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.
Hamlet	5	2	3391	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: ’tis for the head.
Hamlet	5	2	3392	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.
Hamlet	5	2	3393	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
Hamlet	5	2	3394	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Hamlet	5	2	3395	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Hamlet	5	2	3396	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as ’twere—I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter—
Hamlet	5	2	3397	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I beseech you, remember.
Hamlet	5	2	3398	direction	business	Hamlet_Ham	He motions to Osric to put on his hat.
Hamlet	5	2	3399	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes—believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.
Hamlet	5	2	3400	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
Hamlet	5	2	3401	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Hamlet	5	2	3402	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?
Hamlet	5	2	3403	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Sir?
Hamlet	5	2	3404	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	Is ’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will to ’t, sir, really.
Hamlet	5	2	3405	direction	delivery	Hamlet_Ham	, to Osric
Hamlet	5	2	3406	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Hamlet	5	2	3407	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Of Laertes?
Hamlet	5	2	3408	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	His purse is empty already; all ’s golden words are spent.
Hamlet	5	2	3409	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Of him, sir.
Hamlet	5	2	3410	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	I know you are not ignorant—
Hamlet	5	2	3411	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
Hamlet	5	2	3412	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—
Hamlet	5	2	3413	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence. But to know a man well were to know himself.
Hamlet	5	2	3414	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellowed.
Hamlet	5	2	3415	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	What’s his weapon?
Hamlet	5	2	3416	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Rapier and dagger.
Hamlet	5	2	3417	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	That’s two of his weapons. But, well—
Hamlet	5	2	3418	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
Hamlet	5	2	3419	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	What call you the “carriages”?
Hamlet	5	2	3420	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
Hamlet	5	2	3421	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
Hamlet	5	2	3422	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I would it might be “hangers” till then. But on. Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages— that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all “impawned,” as you call it?
Hamlet	5	2	3423	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your Lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
Hamlet	5	2	3424	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	How if I answer no?
Hamlet	5	2	3425	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Hamlet	5	2	3426	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can. If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
Hamlet	5	2	3427	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	Shall I deliver you e’en so?
Hamlet	5	2	3428	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
Hamlet	5	2	3429	speech	prose	Osric_Ham	I commend my duty to your Lordship.
Hamlet	5	2	3430	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Yours. He does well to commend it himself. There are no tongues else for ’s turn.
Hamlet	5	2	3431	direction	exit	Osric_Ham	Osric exits.
Hamlet	5	2	3432	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
Hamlet	5	2	3433	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same breed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got the tune of the time, and, out of an habit of encounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

Hamlet	5	2	3435	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_Ham	My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
Hamlet	5	2	3436	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I am constant to my purposes. They follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Hamlet	5	2	3437	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_Ham	The King and Queen and all are coming down.

Hamlet	5	2	3442	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	You will lose, my lord.
Hamlet	5	2	3443	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart. But it is no matter.
Hamlet	5	2	3444	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	Nay, good my lord—
Hamlet	5	2	3445	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
Hamlet	5	2	3446	speech	prose	Horatio_Ham	If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.
Hamlet	5	2	3447	speech	prose	Hamlet_Ham	Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is ’t to leave betimes?
