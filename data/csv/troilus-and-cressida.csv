Troilus and Cressida	1	1	1	direction	entrance	Troilus_Tro	Enter Pandarus and Troilus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	2	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Call here my varlet; I’ll unarm again.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	3	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Why should I war without the walls of Troy
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	4	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	That find such cruel battle here within?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	5	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	6	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	7	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Will this gear ne’er be mended?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	8	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	9	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	10	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	But I am weaker than a woman’s tear,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	11	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	12	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Less valiant than the virgin in the night,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	13	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And skilless as unpracticed infancy.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	14	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Well, I have told you enough of this. For my part, I’ll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	15	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Have I not tarried?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	16	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	17	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Have I not tarried?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	18	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	19	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Still have I tarried.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	20	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Ay, to the leavening; but here’s yet in the word hereafter the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating the oven, and the baking. Nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance burn your lips.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	21	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Patience herself, what goddess e’er she be,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	22	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Doth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	23	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	At Priam’s royal table do I sit
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	24	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts—
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	25	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	So, traitor! “When she comes”? When is she thence?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	26	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any woman else.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	27	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I was about to tell thee: when my heart,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	28	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	As wedgèd with a sigh, would rive in twain,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	29	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	30	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I have, as when the sun doth light a-scorn,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	31	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile;
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	32	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	But sorrow that is couched in seeming gladness
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	33	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	34	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen’s—well, go to—there were no more comparison between the women. But, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra’s wit, but—
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	35	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	O, Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus:
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	36	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drowned,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	37	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Reply not in how many fathoms deep
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	38	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	They lie indrenched. I tell thee I am mad
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	39	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	In Cressid’s love. Thou answer’st she is fair;
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	40	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	41	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	42	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Handiest in thy discourse—O—that her hand,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	43	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	In whose comparison all whites are ink
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	44	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	45	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	46	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Hard as the palm of plowman. This thou tell’st me,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	47	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	As true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	48	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	49	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	50	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The knife that made it.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	51	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	I speak no more than truth.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	52	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Thou dost not speak so much.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	53	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Faith, I’ll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is. If she be fair, ’tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	54	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Good Pandarus—how now, Pandarus?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	55	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	I have had my labor for my travail, ill thought on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labor.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	56	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	57	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Because she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not so fair as Helen; an she were not kin to me, she would be as fair o’ Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she were a blackamoor; ’tis all one to me.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	58	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Say I she is not fair?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	59	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks, and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ th’ matter.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	60	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Pandarus—
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	61	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Not I.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	62	speech	prose	Troilus_Tro	Sweet Pandarus—
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	63	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Pray you speak no more to me. I will leave all as I found it, and there an end.

Troilus and Cressida	1	1	65	direction	sound		Sound alarum.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	66	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Peace, you ungracious clamors! Peace, rude sounds!
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	67	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	68	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	69	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I cannot fight upon this argument;
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	70	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	It is too starved a subject for my sword.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	71	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	But Pandarus—O gods, how do you plague me!
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	72	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	73	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And he’s as tetchy to be wooed to woo
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	74	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	75	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphnes love,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	76	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	77	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	78	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Between our Ilium and where she resides,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	79	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Let it be called the wild and wand’ring flood,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	80	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar

Troilus and Cressida	1	1	84	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	How now, Prince Troilus? Wherefore not afield?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	85	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Because not there. This woman’s answer sorts,
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	86	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	For womanish it is to be from thence.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	87	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	What news, Aeneas, from the field today?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	88	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	That Paris is returnèd home, and hurt.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	89	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	By whom, Aeneas?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	90	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Troilus, by Menelaus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	91	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Let Paris bleed. ’Tis but a scar to scorn;
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	92	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Paris is gored with Menelaus’ horn.

Troilus and Cressida	1	1	94	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Hark what good sport is out of town today!
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	95	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Better at home, if “would I might” were “may.”
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	96	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	But to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?
Troilus and Cressida	1	1	97	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	In all swift haste.

Troilus and Cressida	1	2	101	speech	verse	Cressida_Tro	Who were those went by?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	102	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	Queen Hecuba and Helen.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	103	speech	verse	Cressida_Tro	And whither go they?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	104	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	Up to the eastern tower,
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	105	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	106	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	107	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	Is as a virtue fixed, today was moved.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	108	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	He chid Andromache and struck his armorer;
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	109	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	And, like as there were husbandry in war,
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	110	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	Before the sun rose he was harnessed light,
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	111	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	And to the field goes he, where every flower
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	112	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	113	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	In Hector’s wrath.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	114	speech	verse	Cressida_Tro	What was his cause of anger?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	115	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	116	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	117	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	They call him Ajax.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	118	speech	verse	Cressida_Tro	Good; and what of him?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	119	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	They say he is a very man per se
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	120	speech	verse	Alexander_Tro	And stands alone.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	121	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	So do all men unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	122	speech	prose	Alexander_Tro	This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions. He is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant, a man into whom nature hath so crowded humors that his valor is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair. He hath the joints of everything, but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	123	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	But how should this man that makes me smile make Hector angry?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	124	speech	prose	Alexander_Tro	They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	125	direction	entrance	Pandarus_Tro	Enter Pandarus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	126	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Who comes here?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	127	speech	prose	Alexander_Tro	Madam, your Uncle Pandarus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	128	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Hector’s a gallant man.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	129	speech	prose	Alexander_Tro	As may be in the world, lady.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	130	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	What’s that? What’s that?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	131	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Good morrow, Uncle Pandarus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	132	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Good morrow, Cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?— Good morrow, Alexander.—How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	133	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	This morning, uncle.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	134	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector armed and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	135	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	136	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	E’en so. Hector was stirring early.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	137	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	That were we talking of, and of his anger.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	138	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Was he angry?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	139	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	So he says here.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	140	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	True, he was so. I know the cause too. He’ll lay about him today, I can tell them that; and there’s Troilus will not come far behind him. Let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	141	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	What, is he angry too?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	142	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	143	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	O Jupiter, there’s no comparison.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	144	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	145	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	146	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	147	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	148	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	149	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	’Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	150	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	151	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	So he is.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	152	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	153	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	He is not Hector.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	154	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Himself? No, he’s not himself. Would he were himself! Well, the gods are above. Time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	155	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Excuse me.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	156	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	He is elder.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	157	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Pardon me, pardon me.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	158	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Th’ other's not come to ’t. You shall tell me another tale when th’ other’s come to ’t. Hector shall not have his wit this year.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	159	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	He shall not need it, if he have his own.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	160	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Nor his qualities.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	161	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	No matter.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	162	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Nor his beauty.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	163	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	’Twould not become him. His own ’s better.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	164	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th’ other day that Troilus, for a brown favor— for so ’tis, I must confess—not brown neither—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	165	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	No, but brown.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	166	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	167	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	To say the truth, true and not true.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	168	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	She praised his complexion above Paris’.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	169	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Why, Paris hath color enough.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	170	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	So he has.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	171	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Then Troilus should have too much. If she praised him above, his complexion is higher than his. He having color enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief Helen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	172	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	173	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Then she’s a merry Greek indeed.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	174	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’ other day into the compassed window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	175	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Indeed, a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	176	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	177	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	178	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	179	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	180	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Why, you know ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	181	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	O, he smiles valiantly.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	182	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Does he not?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	183	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	O yes, an ’twere a cloud in autumn.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	184	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Why, go to, then. But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	185	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Troilus will stand to the proof if you’ll prove it so.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	186	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Troilus? Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	187	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would eat chickens i’ th’ shell.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	188	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I must needs confess—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	189	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Without the rack.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	190	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	191	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	192	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed that her eyes ran o’er—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	193	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	With millstones.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	194	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	And Cassandra laughed—
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	195	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o’er too?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	196	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	And Hector laughed.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	197	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	At what was all this laughing?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	198	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’ chin.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	199	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	An ’t had been a green hair, I should have laughed too.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	200	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	201	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	What was his answer?
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	202	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	Quoth she “Here’s but two-and-fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them is white.”
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	203	speech	prose	Cressida_Tro	This is her question.
Troilus and Cressida	1	2	204	speech	prose	Pandarus_Tro	That’s true, make no question of that. “Two-and-fifty hairs,” quoth he, “and one white. That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.” “Jupiter!” quoth she, “which of these hairs is Paris, my husband?” “The forked one,” quoth he. “Pluck ’t out, and give it him.” But there was such laughing, and Helen so blushed, and Paris so chafed, and all the rest so laughed that it passed.

Look you how his sword is bloodied and his helm more hacked than Hector’s, and how he looks, and how he goes. O admirable youth! He never saw three and twenty.—Go thy way, Troilus; go thy way!—Had I a sister were a Grace, or a daughter a goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	406	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Then everything includes itself in power,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	407	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Power into will, will into appetite,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	408	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And appetite, an universal wolf,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	409	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	So doubly seconded with will and power,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	410	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Must make perforce an universal prey
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	411	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	412	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	413	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Follows the choking.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	414	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And this neglection of degree it is
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	415	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	416	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	It hath to climb. The General’s disdained
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	417	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	By him one step below, he by the next,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	418	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That next by him beneath; so every step,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	419	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	420	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	421	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Of pale and bloodless emulation.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	422	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	423	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	424	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	425	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Most wisely hath Ulysses here discovered
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	426	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	The fever whereof all our power is sick.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	427	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	428	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	What is the remedy?
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	429	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	430	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The sinew and the forehand of our host,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	431	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Having his ear full of his airy fame,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	432	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	433	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	434	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Upon a lazy bed, the live-long day
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	435	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Breaks scurril jests,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	436	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And with ridiculous and silly action,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	437	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	438	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	439	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Thy topless deputation he puts on,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	440	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And, like a strutting player whose conceit
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	441	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	442	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	443	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	’Twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	444	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Such to-be-pitied and o’erwrested seeming
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	445	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	446	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquared
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	447	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropped
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	448	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	449	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The large Achilles, on his pressed bed lolling,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	450	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	451	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Cries “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	452	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Now play me Nestor; hem and stroke thy beard,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	453	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	As he being dressed to some oration.”
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	454	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That’s done, as near as the extremest ends
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	455	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	456	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Yet god Achilles still cries “Excellent!
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	457	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	458	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Arming to answer in a night alarm.”
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	459	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	460	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Must be the scene of mirth—to cough and spit,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	461	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	462	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	463	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Sir Valor dies, cries “O, enough, Patroclus,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	464	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	465	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	In pleasure of my spleen.” And in this fashion,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	466	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	467	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Severals and generals of grace exact,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	468	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	469	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	470	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	471	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	472	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	And in the imitation of these twain,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	473	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	474	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	With an imperial voice, many are infect:
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	475	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Ajax is grown self-willed and bears his head
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	476	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	In such a rein, in full as proud a place
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	477	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	478	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	479	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites—
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	480	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint—
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	481	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	To match us in comparisons with dirt,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	482	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	To weaken and discredit our exposure,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	483	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	How rank soever rounded in with danger.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	484	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	They tax our policy and call it cowardice,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	485	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Count wisdom as no member of the war,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	486	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	487	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	But that of hand. The still and mental parts
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	488	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That do contrive how many hands shall strike
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	489	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	When fitness calls them on and know by measure
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	490	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Of their observant toil the enemy’s weight—
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	491	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Why, this hath not a fingers dignity.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	492	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet war;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	493	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	So that the ram that batters down the wall,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	494	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	495	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	They place before his hand that made the engine
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	496	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Or those that with the fineness of their souls
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	497	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	By reason guide his execution.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	498	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Let this be granted, and Achilles’ horse

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	516	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Ay. I ask that I might waken reverence
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	517	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	518	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Modest as morning when she coldly eyes

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	525	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	As bending angels—that’s their fame in peace.

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	528	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	529	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Peace, Trojan. Lay thy finger on thy lips.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	530	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	The worthiness of praise distains his worth
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	531	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	If that the praised himself bring the praise forth.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	532	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	But what the repining enemy commends,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	533	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	534	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	535	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Ay, Greek, that is my name.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	536	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	What’s your affair, I pray you?
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	537	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Sir, pardon. ’Tis for Agamemnon’s ears.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	538	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	539	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	540	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	541	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	To set his sense on the attentive bent,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	542	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	And then to speak.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	543	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	Speak frankly as the wind;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	544	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	It is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	545	speech	verse	Agamemnon_Tro	That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	555	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	572	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	If any come, Hector shall honor him;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	573	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	574	speech	verse	Aeneas_Tro	The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth

Troilus and Cressida	1	3	630	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	If not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	631	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	632	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	633	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	With their fin’st palate. And, trust to me, Ulysses,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	634	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Our imputation shall be oddly poised
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	635	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	In this vile action. For the success,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	636	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Although particular, shall give a scantling
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	637	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Of good or bad unto the general;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	638	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	And in such indexes, although small pricks
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	639	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	640	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	The baby figure of the giant mass
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	641	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Of things to come at large. It is supposed
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	642	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	He that meets Hector issues from our choice;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	643	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	644	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Makes merit her election and doth boil,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	645	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	As ’twere from forth us all, a man distilled
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	646	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Out of our virtues, who, miscarrying,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	647	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	What heart receives from hence a conquering part
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	648	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	To steel a strong opinion to themselves?—
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	649	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Which entertained, limbs are his instruments,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	650	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	In no less working than are swords and bows
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	651	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Directive by the limbs.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	652	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Give pardon to my speech: therefore ’tis meet
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	653	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Achilles meet not Hector. Let us like merchants
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	654	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	First show foul wares and think perchance they’ll sell;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	655	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	If not, the luster of the better shall exceed
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	656	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	By showing the worse first. Do not consent
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	657	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That ever Hector and Achilles meet,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	658	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For both our honor and our shame in this
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	659	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Are dogged with two strange followers.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	660	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	661	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	662	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Were he not proud, we all should share with him;
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	663	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	But he already is too insolent,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	664	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And it were better parch in Afric sun
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	665	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	666	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foiled,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	667	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Why then we do our main opinion crush
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	668	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	669	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	670	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	671	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Give him allowance for the better man,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	672	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For that will physic the great Myrmidon,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	673	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	674	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	675	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	676	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	677	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Yet go we under our opinion still
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	678	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	679	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	680	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Ajax employed plucks down Achilles’ plumes.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	681	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	682	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	683	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	684	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone
Troilus and Cressida	1	3	685	speech	verse	Nestor_Tro	Must tar the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	698	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness, but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike, canst thou? A red murrain o’ thy jade’s tricks.

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	702	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	703	speech	prose	Ajax_Tro	Do not, porpentine, do not. My fingers itch.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	704	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	I would thou didst itch from head to foot, and I had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	705	speech	prose	Ajax_Tro	I say, the proclamation!
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	706	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles, and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpina’s beauty, ay, that thou bark’st at him.

Thou art here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou.

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	728	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	Well, why, so I do.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	729	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	But yet you look not well upon him, for whosomever you take him to be, he is Ajax.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	730	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	I know that, fool.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	731	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Ay, but that fool knows not himself.

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	733	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones. I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow. This lord, Achilles—Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly, and his guts in his head—I’ll tell you what I say of him.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	734	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	What?

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	749	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	What’s the quarrel?
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	750	speech	prose	Ajax_Tro	I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation, and he rails upon me.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	751	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	I serve thee not.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	752	speech	prose	Ajax_Tro	Well, go to, go to.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	753	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	I serve here voluntary.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	754	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	Your last service was suff’rance; ’twas not voluntary. No man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	755	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	E’en so. A great deal of your wit, too, lies in your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall have a great catch an he knock out either of your brains; he were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	756	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	What, with me too, Thersites?
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	757	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	There’s Ulysses and old Nestor—whose wit was moldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes—yoke you like draft-oxen and make you plow up the wars.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	758	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	What? What?
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	759	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Yes, good sooth. To, Achilles! To, Ajax! To—
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	760	speech	prose	Ajax_Tro	I shall cut out your tongue.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	761	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	’Tis no matter. I shall speak as much as thou afterwards.

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	764	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	There’s for you, Patroclus.
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	765	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	I will see you hanged like clodpolls ere I come any more to your tents. I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.

Troilus and Cressida	2	1	775	speech	verse	Ajax_Tro	Farewell. Who shall answer him?
Troilus and Cressida	2	1	776	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	I know not. ’Tis put to lott’ry. Otherwise,

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	783	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	784	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	“Deliver Helen, and all damage else—
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	785	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	As honor, loss of time, travel, expense,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	786	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	787	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	In hot digestion of this cormorant war—
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	788	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	Shall be struck off.”—Hector, what say you to ’t?
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	789	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	790	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	As far as toucheth my particular,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	791	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Yet, dread Priam,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	792	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	There is no lady of more softer bowels,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	793	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	794	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	More ready to cry out “Who knows what follows?”
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	795	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	796	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Surety secure; but modest doubt is called
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	797	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	798	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	799	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	800	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Every tithe soul, ’mongst many thousand dismes,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	801	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	802	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	If we have lost so many tenths of ours
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	803	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To guard a thing not ours—nor worth to us,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	804	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Had it our name, the value of one ten—
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	805	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	What merit’s in that reason which denies
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	806	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	The yielding of her up?
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	807	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Fie, fie, my brother,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	808	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Weigh you the worth and honor of a king
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	809	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	So great as our dread father’s in a scale
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	810	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	811	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The past-proportion of his infinite,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	812	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And buckle in a waist most fathomless
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	813	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	With spans and inches so diminutive
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	814	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	815	speech	verse	Helenus_Tro	No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	816	speech	verse	Helenus_Tro	You are so empty of them. Should not our father
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	817	speech	verse	Helenus_Tro	Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	818	speech	verse	Helenus_Tro	Because your speech hath none that tell him so?
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	819	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	820	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	821	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	You know an enemy intends you harm;
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	822	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	You know a sword employed is perilous,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	823	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And reason flies the object of all harm.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	824	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	825	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	826	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The very wings of reason to his heels
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	827	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	828	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Or like a star disorbed? Nay, if we talk of reason,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	829	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Let’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honor
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	830	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	831	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	With this crammed reason. Reason and respect
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	832	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	833	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	835	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	What’s aught but as ’tis valued?
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	836	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	But value dwells not in particular will;

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	838	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	As well wherein ’tis precious of itself
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	839	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	840	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To make the service greater than the god;
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	841	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	And the will dotes that is attributive

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	844	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I take today a wife, and my election
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	845	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Is led on in the conduct of my will—
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	846	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	847	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	848	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Of will and judgment. How may I avoid,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	849	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Although my will distaste what it elected,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	850	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The wife I choose? There can be no evasion
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	851	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	To blench from this and to stand firm by honor.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	852	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	We turn not back the silks upon the merchant

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	855	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Because we now are full. It was thought meet
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	856	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	857	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Your breath with full consent bellied his sails;
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	858	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	859	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And did him service. He touched the ports desired,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	860	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	861	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	862	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Wrinkles Apollo’s and makes pale the morning.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	863	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	864	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	865	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	866	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And turned crowned kings to merchants.

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	903	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Some touches of remorse? Or is your blood

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	912	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	913	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Which hath our several honors all engaged
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	914	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	To make it gracious. For my private part,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	915	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I am no more touched than all Priam’s sons;
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	916	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	917	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	918	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	To fight for and maintain!

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	921	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	But I attest the gods, your full consent
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	922	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Gave wings to my propension and cut off
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	923	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	All fears attending on so dire a project.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	924	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	For what, alas, can these my single arms?
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	925	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	What propugnation is in one man’s valor
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	926	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	To stand the push and enmity of those
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	927	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	928	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Were I alone to pass the difficulties
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	929	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	And had as ample power as I have will,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	930	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Paris should ne’er retract what he hath done
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	931	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Nor faint in the pursuit.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	932	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	Paris, you speak
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	933	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	Like one besotted on your sweet delights.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	934	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	You have the honey still, but these the gall.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	935	speech	verse	Priam_Tro	So to be valiant is no praise at all.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	936	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Sir, I propose not merely to myself
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	937	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	938	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	939	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Wiped off in honorable keeping her.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	940	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	What treason were it to the ransacked queen,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	941	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	942	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Now to deliver her possession up
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	943	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	On terms of base compulsion? Can it be
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	944	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	That so degenerate a strain as this
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	945	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	946	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	There’s not the meanest spirit on our party
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	947	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	948	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	949	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Whose life were ill bestowed or death unfamed
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	950	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Where Helen is the subject. Then I say,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	951	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	952	speech	verse	Paris_Tro	The world’s large spaces cannot parallel.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	953	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	954	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	And on the cause and question now in hand
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	955	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Have glozed—but superficially, not much
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	956	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	957	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	958	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	The reasons you allege do more conduce
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	959	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To the hot passion of distempered blood
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	960	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Than to make up a free determination
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	961	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	’Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	962	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	963	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Of any true decision. Nature craves
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	964	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	All dues be rendered to their owners. Now,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	965	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	What nearer debt in all humanity
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	966	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	967	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Of nature be corrupted through affection,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	968	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	And that great minds, of partial indulgence
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	969	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To their benumbèd wills, resist the same,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	970	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	There is a law in each well-ordered nation
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	971	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To curb those raging appetites that are
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	972	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Most disobedient and refractory.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	973	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	If Helen, then, be wife to Sparta’s king,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	974	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	As it is known she is, these moral laws
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	975	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Of nature and of nations speak aloud
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	976	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To have her back returned. Thus to persist
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	977	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	978	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	But makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	979	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Is this in way of truth; yet, ne’ertheless,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	980	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	My sprightly brethren, I propend to you
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	981	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	In resolution to keep Helen still,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	982	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	For ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	983	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Upon our joint and several dignities.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	984	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Why, there you touched the life of our design!
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	985	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Were it not glory that we more affected
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	986	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	987	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	988	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Spent more in her defense. But, worthy Hector,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	989	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	She is a theme of honor and renown,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	990	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	991	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	992	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And fame in time to come canonize us;
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	993	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	For I presume brave Hector would not lose
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	994	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	So rich advantage of a promised glory
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	995	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	As smiles upon the forehead of this action
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	996	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	For the wide world’s revenue.
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	997	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	I am yours,

Troilus and Cressida	2	2	1000	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
Troilus and Cressida	2	2	1001	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.

Then there’s Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods; and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if you take not that little, little, less than little wit from them that they have, which short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! For that, methinks, is the curse depending on those that war for a placket.

Troilus and Cressida	2	3	1065	speech	prose	Ulysses_Tro	No. You see, he is his argument that has his argument: Achilles.
Troilus and Cressida	2	3	1066	speech	prose	Nestor_Tro	All the better. Their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite.

Troilus and Cressida	2	3	1115	speech	prose	Agamemnon_Tro	No, noble Ajax. You are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.
Troilus and Cressida	2	3	1116	speech	prose	Ajax_Tro	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.
Troilus and Cressida	2	3	1117	speech	prose	Agamemnon_Tro	Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.

Troilus and Cressida	3	2	1480	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	How were I then uplifted! But, alas,
Troilus and Cressida	3	2	1481	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	I am as true as truth’s simplicity
Troilus and Cressida	3	2	1482	speech	verse	Troilus_Tro	And simpler than the infancy of truth.

Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1644	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1645	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	I do not strain at the position—
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1646	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	It is familiar—but at the author’s drift,

Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1651	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1652	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Till he behold them formed in the applause
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1653	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Where they’re extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1654	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The voice again or, like a gate of steel
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1655	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1656	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1657	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And apprehended here immediately
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1658	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Th’ unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1659	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	A very horse, that has he knows not what!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1660	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Nature, what things there are
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1661	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Most abject in regard, and dear in use,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1662	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	What things again most dear in the esteem
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1663	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1664	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	An act that very chance doth throw upon him—
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1665	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Ajax renowned. O, heavens, what some men do
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1666	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	While some men leave to do!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1667	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1668	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1669	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	How one man eats into another’s pride,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1670	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1671	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	To see these Grecian lords—why, even already
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1672	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1673	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1674	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And great Troy shrieking.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1675	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	I do believe it, for they passed by me
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1676	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1677	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1678	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1679	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1680	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1681	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1682	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1683	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1684	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Keeps honor bright. To have done is to hang
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1685	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1686	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1687	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For honor travels in a strait so narrow
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1688	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Where one but goes abreast. Keep, then, the path,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1689	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For Emulation hath a thousand sons
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1690	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That one by one pursue. If you give way
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1691	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Or turn aside from the direct forthright,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1692	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Like to an entered tide they all rush by
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1693	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And leave you hindmost;
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1694	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Or, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1695	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1696	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	O’errun and trampled on. Then what they do in present,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1697	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Though less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1698	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For Time is like a fashionable host
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1699	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1700	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1701	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Grasps in the comer. Welcome ever smiles,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1702	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And Farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1703	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Remuneration for the thing it was,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1704	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	For beauty, wit,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1705	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1706	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Love, friendship, charity are subjects all
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1707	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	To envious and calumniating Time.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1708	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1709	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That all, with one consent, praise newborn gauds,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1710	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Though they are made and molded of things past,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1711	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And give to dust that is a little gilt
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1712	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	More laud than gilt o’erdusted.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1713	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The present eye praises the present object.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1714	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1715	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1716	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1717	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1718	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And still it might, and yet it may again,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1719	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1720	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And case thy reputation in thy tent,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1721	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1722	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1723	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And drave great Mars to faction.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1724	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Of this my privacy,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1725	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	I have strong reasons.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1726	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	But ’gainst your privacy
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1727	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The reasons are more potent and heroical.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1728	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1729	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	With one of Priam’s daughters.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1730	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Ha? Known?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1731	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Is that a wonder?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1732	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	The providence that’s in a watchful state
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1733	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Knows almost every grain of Pluto’s gold,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1734	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1735	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1736	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1737	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	There is a mystery—with whom relation
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1738	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Durst never meddle—in the soul of state,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1739	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Which hath an operation more divine
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1740	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Than breath or pen can give expressure to.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1741	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	All the commerce that you have had with Troy
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1742	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1743	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And better would it fit Achilles much
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1744	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	To throw down Hector than Polyxena.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1745	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1746	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	When Fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1747	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1748	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	“Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1749	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.”
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1750	speech	verse	Ulysses_Tro	Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.

Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1753	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1754	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	A woman impudent and mannish grown
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1755	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1756	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	In time of action. I stand condemned for this.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1757	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	They think my little stomach to the war,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1758	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	And your great love to me, restrains you thus.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1759	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1760	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1761	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	And, like a dewdrop from the lion’s mane,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1762	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Be shook to air.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1763	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1764	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1765	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	I see my reputation is at stake;
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1766	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	My fame is shrewdly gored.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1767	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	O, then, beware!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1768	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1769	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Omission to do what is necessary
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1770	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Seals a commission to a blank of danger,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1771	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1772	speech	verse	Patroclus_Tro	Even then when they sit idly in the sun.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1773	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1774	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	I’ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1775	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	T’ invite the Trojan lords after the combat
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1776	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	To see us here unarmed. I have a woman’s longing,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1777	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	An appetite that I am sick withal,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1778	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1779	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	To talk with him, and to behold his visage,
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1780	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Even to my full of view.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1781	direction	entrance	Thersites_Tro	Enter Thersites.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1782	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	A labor saved.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1783	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	A wonder!
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1784	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	What?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1785	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1786	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	How so?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1787	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling that he raves in saying nothing.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1788	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	How can that be?
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1789	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock— a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say “There were wit in this head an ’twould out”—and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. The man’s undone forever, for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat, he’ll break ’t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said “Good morrow, Ajax,” and he replies “Thanks, Agamemnon.” What think you of this man that takes me for the General? He’s grown a very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1790	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1791	speech	prose	Thersites_Tro	Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody. He professes not answering; speaking is for beggars; he wears his tongue in ’s arms. I will put on his presence. Let Patroclus make his demands to me. You shall see the pageant of Ajax.
Troilus and Cressida	3	3	1792	speech	prose	Achilles_Tro	To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious, six-or-seven-times-honored captain general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon, et cetera. Do this.

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2475	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2476	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all,

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2492	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Thou art too brief. I will the second time,

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2495	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	But there’s more in me than thou understand’st.
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2496	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2499	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	That I may give the local wound a name

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2501	speech	verse	Achilles_Tro	Hector’s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens!
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2502	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2503	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	To answer such a question. Stand again.

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2508	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,

Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2513	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2514	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	His insolence draws folly from my lips.
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2515	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	But I’ll endeavor deeds to match these words,
Troilus and Cressida	4	5	2516	speech	verse	Hector_Tro	Or may I never—

Here’s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as earwax. And the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull—the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother’s leg—to what form but that he is should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to? To an ass were nothing; he is both ass and ox. To an ox were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus! I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites, for I care not to be the louse of a lazar so I were not Menelaus.
