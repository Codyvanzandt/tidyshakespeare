All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	2	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	3	speech	prose	Bertram_AWW	And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	4	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	5	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	What hope is there of his Majesty’s amendment?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	6	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	7	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	This young gentlewoman had a father—O, that “had,” how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the King’s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the King’s disease.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	8	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	How called you the man you speak of, madam?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	9	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	10	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	He was excellent indeed, madam. The King very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly. He was skillful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	11	speech	prose	Bertram_AWW	What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	12	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	A fistula, my lord.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	13	speech	prose	Bertram_AWW	I heard not of it before.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	14	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	I would it were not notorious.—Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	15	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises. Her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity—they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness. She derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	16	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	17	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek.—No more of this, Helena. Go to. No more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have—
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	18	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	19	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	20	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	21	speech	prose	Bertram_AWW	Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	22	speech	prose	Lafew_AWW	How understand we that?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	23	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	26	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	27	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	28	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	29	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	Under thy own life’s key Be checked for silence,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	30	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	31	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	32	speech	verse	Countess_AWW	Fall on thy head. Farewell, my lord.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	46	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	And these great tears grace his remembrance more
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	47	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	48	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	I have forgot him. My imagination
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	49	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Carries no favor in ’t but Bertram’s.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	50	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	I am undone. There is no living, none,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	51	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	52	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	That I should love a bright particular star
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	53	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	And think to wed it, he is so above me.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	54	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	In his bright radiance and collateral light
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	55	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	56	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Th’ ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	58	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	68	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Think him a great way fool, solely a coward.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	69	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	71	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind. Withal, full oft we see

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	74	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	And you, monarch.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	75	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	No.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	76	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	And no.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	77	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	Are you meditating on virginity?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	78	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity. How may we barricado it against him?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	79	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	Keep him out.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	80	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	81	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	There is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	82	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	83	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion. Away with ’t.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	84	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	85	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	There’s little can be said in ’t. ’Tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by ’t. Out with ’t! Within ten year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with ’t!
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	86	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	87	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with ’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears: it looks ill, it eats dryly; marry, ’tis a withered pear. It was formerly better, marry, yet ’tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	88	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	Not my virginity, yet—
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	89	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	There shall your master have a thousand loves,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	90	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	102	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	That I wish well. ’Tis pity—
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	103	speech	verse	Parolles_AWW	What’s pity?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	104	speech	verse	Helen_AWW	That wishing well had not a body in ’t

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	120	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	Why think you so?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	121	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	You go so much backward when you fight.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	123	speech	prose	Helen_AWW	So is running away, when fear proposes the safety. But the composition that your valor and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	1	124	speech	prose	Parolles_AWW	I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	187	speech	verse	King_AWW	His equal had awaked them, and his honor,

All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	189	speech	verse	King_AWW	Exception bid him speak, and at this time
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	190	speech	verse	King_AWW	His tongue obeyed his hand. Who were below him
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	191	speech	verse	King_AWW	He used as creatures of another place

All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	194	speech	verse	King_AWW	In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	195	speech	verse	King_AWW	Might be a copy to these younger times,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	196	speech	verse	King_AWW	Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now

All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	202	speech	verse	King_AWW	Would I were with him! He would always say—
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	203	speech	verse	King_AWW	Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	204	speech	verse	King_AWW	He scattered not in ears, but grafted them
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	205	speech	verse	King_AWW	To grow there and to bear. “Let me not live”—
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	206	speech	verse	King_AWW	This his good melancholy oft began
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	207	speech	verse	King_AWW	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	208	speech	verse	King_AWW	When it was out—“Let me not live,” quoth he,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	209	speech	verse	King_AWW	“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	210	speech	verse	King_AWW	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	211	speech	verse	King_AWW	All but new things disdain, whose judgments are
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	212	speech	verse	King_AWW	Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	213	speech	verse	King_AWW	Expire before their fashions.” This he wished.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	214	speech	verse	King_AWW	I, after him, do after him wish too,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	215	speech	verse	King_AWW	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
All's Well That Ends Well	1	2	216	speech	verse	King_AWW	I quickly were dissolvèd from my hive

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	234	speech	prose	Steward_AWW	Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavors, for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish them.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	235	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe. ’Tis my slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	240	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	241	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	I do beg your good will in this case.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	243	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o’ my body, for they say bairns are blessings.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	245	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	246	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	Is this all your Worship’s reason?
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	247	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	249	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are, and indeed I do marry that I may repent.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	251	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	I am out o’ friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s sake.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	252	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	253	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	You’re shallow, madam, in great friends, for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend. Ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage, for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the Papist, howsome’er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ th’ herd.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	275	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	276	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ th’ song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth he? An we might have a good woman born but or every blazing star or at an earthquake, ’twould mend the lottery well. A man may draw his heart out ere he pluck one.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	277	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	278	speech	prose	Fool_AWW	That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no Puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.

All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	282	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to me, and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than she’ll demand.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	283	speech	prose	Steward_AWW	Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me. Alone she was and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal, sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns you something to know it.
All's Well That Ends Well	1	3	284	speech	prose	Countess_AWW	You have discharged this honestly. Keep it to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tott’ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom, and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.
