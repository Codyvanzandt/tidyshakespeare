Timon of Athens	1	1	3	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	I am glad you’re well.
Timon of Athens	1	1	4	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	I have not seen you long. How goes the world?
Timon of Athens	1	1	5	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	It wears, sir, as it grows.
Timon of Athens	1	1	6	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Ay, that’s well known.
Timon of Athens	1	1	7	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	But what particular rarity, what strange,
Timon of Athens	1	1	8	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Which manifold record not matches? See,
Timon of Athens	1	1	9	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power
Timon of Athens	1	1	10	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
Timon of Athens	1	1	11	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	I know them both. Th’ other’s a jeweler.
Timon of Athens	1	1	12	direction	delivery	Merchant_Tim	, to Jeweler
Timon of Athens	1	1	13	speech	verse	Merchant_Tim	O, ’tis a worthy lord!
Timon of Athens	1	1	14	speech	verse	Jeweler_Tim	Nay, that’s most fixed.
Timon of Athens	1	1	15	speech	verse	Merchant_Tim	A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
Timon of Athens	1	1	16	speech	verse	Merchant_Tim	To an untirable and continuate goodness.

Timon of Athens	1	1	18	speech	verse	Jeweler_Tim	I have a jewel here—

Timon of Athens	1	1	20	speech	verse	Jeweler_Tim	If he will touch the estimate. But for that—
Timon of Athens	1	1	21	direction	delivery	Poet_Tim	, to Painter
Timon of Athens	1	1	22	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	When we for recompense have praised the vile,
Timon of Athens	1	1	23	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	It stains the glory in that happy verse
Timon of Athens	1	1	24	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Which aptly sings the good.

Timon of Athens	1	1	31	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	A thing slipped idly from me.
Timon of Athens	1	1	32	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Our poesy is as a gum which oozes
Timon of Athens	1	1	33	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	From whence ’tis nourished. The fire i’ th’ flint
Timon of Athens	1	1	34	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
Timon of Athens	1	1	35	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Provokes itself and, like the current, flies
Timon of Athens	1	1	36	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Each bound it chases. What have you there?

Timon of Athens	1	1	38	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Timon of Athens	1	1	39	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Let’s see your piece.
Timon of Athens	1	1	40	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	’Tis a good piece.

Timon of Athens	1	1	42	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	Indifferent.
Timon of Athens	1	1	43	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Admirable! How this grace
Timon of Athens	1	1	44	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Speaks his own standing! What a mental power
Timon of Athens	1	1	45	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	This eye shoots forth! How big imagination
Timon of Athens	1	1	46	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture
Timon of Athens	1	1	47	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	One might interpret.
Timon of Athens	1	1	48	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Timon of Athens	1	1	49	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	Here is a touch. Is ’t good?
Timon of Athens	1	1	50	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	I will say of it,
Timon of Athens	1	1	51	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	It tutors nature. Artificial strife

Timon of Athens	1	1	60	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
Timon of Athens	1	1	61	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	With amplest entertainment. My free drift
Timon of Athens	1	1	62	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Halts not particularly but moves itself
Timon of Athens	1	1	63	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	In a wide sea of wax. No leveled malice
Timon of Athens	1	1	64	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Infects one comma in the course I hold,
Timon of Athens	1	1	65	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Timon of Athens	1	1	66	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Leaving no tract behind.
Timon of Athens	1	1	67	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	How shall I understand you?
Timon of Athens	1	1	68	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	I will unbolt to you.

Timon of Athens	1	1	71	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Of grave and austere quality, tender down

Timon of Athens	1	1	74	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
Timon of Athens	1	1	75	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	All sorts of hearts—yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
Timon of Athens	1	1	76	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Timon of Athens	1	1	77	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Than to abhor himself; even he drops down
Timon of Athens	1	1	78	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	The knee before him and returns in peace
Timon of Athens	1	1	79	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Most rich in Timon’s nod.

Timon of Athens	1	1	81	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Timon of Athens	1	1	82	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Feigned Fortune to be throned. The base o’ th’ mount

Timon of Athens	1	1	84	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	That labor on the bosom of this sphere
Timon of Athens	1	1	85	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	To propagate their states. Amongst them all

Timon of Athens	1	1	87	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,
Timon of Athens	1	1	88	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,
Timon of Athens	1	1	89	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Timon of Athens	1	1	90	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Translates his rivals.
Timon of Athens	1	1	91	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	’Tis conceived to scope.
Timon of Athens	1	1	92	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
Timon of Athens	1	1	93	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	With one man beckoned from the rest below,
Timon of Athens	1	1	94	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	Bowing his head against the steepy mount
Timon of Athens	1	1	95	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	To climb his happiness, would be well expressed
Timon of Athens	1	1	96	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	In our condition.
Timon of Athens	1	1	97	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Nay, sir, but hear me on.
Timon of Athens	1	1	98	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	All those which were his fellows but of late,
Timon of Athens	1	1	99	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Some better than his value, on the moment

Timon of Athens	1	1	106	speech	verse	Poet_Tim	Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,

Timon of Athens	1	1	112	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s
Timon of Athens	1	1	113	speech	verse	Painter_Tim	More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well

Timon of Athens	3	4	1007	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Titus_Tim	The like to you, kind Varro.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1008	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	Lucius!
Timon of Athens	3	4	1009	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	What, do we meet together?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1010	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Ay, and I think
Timon of Athens	3	4	1011	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	One business does command us all,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1012	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	For mine is money.

Timon of Athens	3	4	1019	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Philotus_Tim	Laboring for nine.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1020	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	So much?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1021	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Philotus_Tim	Is not my lord seen yet?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1022	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Not yet.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1023	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Philotus_Tim	I wonder on ’t. He was wont to shine at seven.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1024	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1025	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	You must consider that a prodigal course
Timon of Athens	3	4	1026	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Is like the sun’s,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1027	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	But not, like his, recoverable. I fear
Timon of Athens	3	4	1028	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	’Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon’s purse:
Timon of Athens	3	4	1029	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	That is, one may reach deep enough and yet
Timon of Athens	3	4	1030	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Find little.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1031	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Philotus_Tim	I am of your fear for that.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1032	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Titus_Tim	I’ll show you how t’ observe a strange event.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1033	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Titus_Tim	Your lord sends now for money?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1034	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	Most true, he does.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1035	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Titus_Tim	And he wears jewels now of Timon’s gift,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1036	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Titus_Tim	For which I wait for money.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1037	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	It is against my heart.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1038	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Mark how strange it shows:
Timon of Athens	3	4	1039	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Timon in this should pay more than he owes,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1040	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	And e’en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
Timon of Athens	3	4	1041	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	And send for money for ’em.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1042	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	I’m weary of this charge, the gods can witness.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1043	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	I know my lord hath spent of Timon’s wealth,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1044	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Hortensius_Tim	And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1045	speech	verse	SERVANTS.VARRO.1_Tim	Yes, mine’s three thousand crowns. What’s yours?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1046	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Five thousand mine.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1047	speech	verse	SERVANTS.VARRO.1_Tim	’Tis much deep, and it should seem by th’ sum
Timon of Athens	3	4	1048	speech	verse	SERVANTS.VARRO.1_Tim	Your master’s confidence was above mine,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1049	speech	verse	SERVANTS.VARRO.1_Tim	Else surely his had equaled.

Timon of Athens	3	4	1062	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	What do you ask of me, my friend?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1063	speech	verse	SERVANTS.Titus_Tim	We wait for certain money here, sir.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1064	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	Ay,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1065	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	If money were as certain as your waiting,
Timon of Athens	3	4	1066	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	’Twere sure enough.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1067	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	Why then preferred you not your sums and bills
Timon of Athens	3	4	1068	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	When your false masters eat of my lord’s meat?
Timon of Athens	3	4	1069	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
Timon of Athens	3	4	1070	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	And take down th’ int’rest into their glutt’nous maws.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1071	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1072	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	Let me pass quietly.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1073	speech	verse	Flavius_Tim	Believe ’t, my lord and I have made an end.

Timon of Athens	3	4	1080	speech	prose	SERVANTS.VARRO.2_Tim	No matter what. He’s poor, and that’s revenge enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in? Such may rail against great buildings.

For take ’t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him. He’s much out of health and keeps his chamber.
Timon of Athens	3	4	1084	speech	verse	SERVANTS.LUCIUS.1_Tim	Many do keep their chambers are not sick;

Timon of Athens	3	5	1180	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	If I speak like a captain.
Timon of Athens	3	5	1181	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	Why do fond men expose themselves to battle
Timon of Athens	3	5	1182	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	And not endure all threats? Sleep upon ’t,

Timon of Athens	3	5	1184	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	Without repugnancy? If there be
Timon of Athens	3	5	1185	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	Such valor in the bearing, what make we
Timon of Athens	3	5	1186	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant
Timon of Athens	3	5	1187	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	That stay at home, if bearing carry it,

Timon of Athens	3	5	1192	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
Timon of Athens	3	5	1193	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust,

Timon of Athens	3	5	1195	speech	verse	Alcibiades_Tim	To be in anger is impiety,

Timon of Athens	3	5	1198	speech	verse	SENATORS.0.2_Tim	You breathe in vain.

Timon of Athens	4	3	1757	speech	verse	Timon_Tim	Thy nature did commence in sufferance. Time
Timon of Athens	4	3	1758	speech	verse	Timon_Tim	Hath made thee hard in ’t. Why shouldst thou hate men?

Timon of Athens	4	3	1760	speech	verse	Timon_Tim	If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,

If thou wert the lamb, the fox would eat thee. If thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dullness would torment thee, and still thou lived’st but as a breakfast to the wolf. If thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury. Wert thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse. Wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the leopard. Wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane to the lion, and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life. All thy safety were remotion, and thy defense absence. What beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast? And what a beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation!
Timon of Athens	4	3	1807	speech	prose	Apemantus_Tim	If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts.
