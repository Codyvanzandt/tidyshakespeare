Pericles	1	1	73	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	I sought a husband, in which labor

Pericles	1	1	86	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;

Pericles	1	1	89	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings
Pericles	1	1	90	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Who, fingered to make man his lawful music,
Pericles	1	1	91	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken;

Pericles	1	1	104	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	For vice repeated is like the wand’ring wind,
Pericles	1	1	105	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Blows dust in others’ eyes to spread itself;
Pericles	1	1	106	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear:
Pericles	1	1	107	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
Pericles	1	1	108	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts

Pericles	1	1	110	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	By man’s oppression, and the poor worm doth die for ’t.
Pericles	1	1	111	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Kings are Earth’s gods; in vice their law’s their will;

Pericles	1	1	115	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	All love the womb that their first being bred;

Pericles	1	1	136	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
Pericles	1	1	137	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Where now you’re both a father and a son

Pericles	1	1	149	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
Pericles	1	1	150	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Ay, and the targets to put off the shame.
Pericles	1	1	151	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Then, lest my life be cropped to keep you clear,

Pericles	1	2	256	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid.
Pericles	1	2	257	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Fit counselor and servant for a prince,
Pericles	1	2	258	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant,
Pericles	1	2	259	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	What wouldst thou have me do?
Pericles	1	2	260	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	To bear with patience such griefs
Pericles	1	2	261	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	As you yourself do lay upon yourself.
Pericles	1	2	262	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Thou speak’st like a physician, Helicanus,
Pericles	1	2	263	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	That ministers a potion unto me
Pericles	1	2	264	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Pericles	1	2	265	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
Pericles	1	2	266	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Where, as thou know’st, against the face of death
Pericles	1	2	267	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
Pericles	1	2	268	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	From whence an issue I might propagate,
Pericles	1	2	269	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
Pericles	1	2	270	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder,
Pericles	1	2	271	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	The rest—hark in thine ear—as black as incest,
Pericles	1	2	272	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
Pericles	1	2	273	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Seemed not to strike, but smooth. But thou know’st this:
Pericles	1	2	274	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	’Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss;
Pericles	1	2	275	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Which fear so grew in me I hither fled
Pericles	1	2	276	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Under the covering of a careful night,
Pericles	1	2	277	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Who seemed my good protector; and, being here,
Pericles	1	2	278	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
Pericles	1	2	279	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants’ fears
Pericles	1	2	280	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Decrease not but grow faster than the years;
Pericles	1	2	281	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And should he doubt, as no doubt he doth,
Pericles	1	2	282	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	That I should open to the list’ning air
Pericles	1	2	283	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	How many worthy princes’ bloods were shed
Pericles	1	2	284	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
Pericles	1	2	285	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	To lop that doubt he’ll fill this land with arms,
Pericles	1	2	286	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;
Pericles	1	2	287	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	When all, for mine—if I may call ’t—offense,
Pericles	1	2	288	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Must feel war’s blow, who spares not innocence;
Pericles	1	2	289	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Which love to all—of which thyself art one,
Pericles	1	2	290	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Who now reproved’st me for ’t—
Pericles	1	2	291	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Alas, sir!
Pericles	1	2	292	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,

Pericles	1	2	294	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
Pericles	1	2	295	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And finding little comfort to relieve them,
Pericles	1	2	296	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.
Pericles	1	2	297	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
Pericles	1	2	298	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
Pericles	1	2	299	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
Pericles	1	2	300	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Who either by public war or private treason
Pericles	1	2	301	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Will take away your life.
Pericles	1	2	302	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
Pericles	1	2	303	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
Pericles	1	2	304	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
Pericles	1	2	305	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Your rule direct to any. If to me,
Pericles	1	2	306	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Day serves not light more faithful than I’ll be.
Pericles	1	2	307	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	I do not doubt thy faith.
Pericles	1	2	308	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
Pericles	1	2	309	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	We’ll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
Pericles	1	2	310	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	From whence we had our being and our birth.
Pericles	1	2	311	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Tyre, I now look from thee, then, and to Tarsus
Pericles	1	2	312	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Intend my travel, where I’ll hear from thee,
Pericles	1	2	313	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And by whose letters I’ll dispose myself.
Pericles	1	2	314	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	The care I had and have of subjects’ good
Pericles	1	2	315	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	On thee I lay, whose wisdom’s strength can bear it.
Pericles	1	2	316	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	I’ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath.
Pericles	1	2	317	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	Who shuns not to break one will crack both.
Pericles	1	2	318	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	But in our orbs we’ll live so round and safe
Pericles	1	2	319	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	That time of both this truth shall ne’er convince.

Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for ’t, for if a king bid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here comes the lords of Tyre.

Pericles	1	3	339	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Took some displeasure at him—at least he judged so;
Pericles	1	3	340	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	And doubting lest he had erred or sinned,
Pericles	1	3	341	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself;
Pericles	1	3	342	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	So puts himself unto the shipman’s toil,

Pericles	1	3	346	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
Pericles	1	3	347	speech	prose	Thaliard_Per	From him I come with message unto princely Pericles, but since my landing I have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels. Now message must return from whence it came.
Pericles	1	3	348	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	We have no reason to desire it,
Pericles	1	3	349	speech	verse	Helicanus_Per	Commended to our master, not to us.

Pericles	1	4	357	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;

Pericles	1	4	372	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	And, wanting breath to speak, help me with tears.
Pericles	1	4	373	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	I’ll do my best, sir.
Pericles	1	4	374	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	This Tarsus, o’er which I have the government,

Pericles	1	4	380	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Like one another’s glass to trim them by;
Pericles	1	4	381	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Their tables were stored full to glad the sight,
Pericles	1	4	382	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	And not so much to feed on as delight;
Pericles	1	4	383	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	All poverty was scorned, and pride so great,
Pericles	1	4	384	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	The name of help grew odious to repeat.
Pericles	1	4	385	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	O, ’tis too true.
Pericles	1	4	386	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	But see what heaven can do by this our change:
Pericles	1	4	387	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	These mouths who but of late earth, sea, and air
Pericles	1	4	388	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Were all too little to content and please,
Pericles	1	4	389	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
Pericles	1	4	390	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	As houses are defiled for want of use,
Pericles	1	4	391	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	They are now starved for want of exercise.
Pericles	1	4	392	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Those palates who not yet two savors younger
Pericles	1	4	393	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Must have inventions to delight the taste,
Pericles	1	4	394	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Would now be glad of bread and beg for it.
Pericles	1	4	395	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Those mothers who, to nuzzle up their babes,
Pericles	1	4	396	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Thought naught too curious, are ready now
Pericles	1	4	397	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
Pericles	1	4	398	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	So sharp are hunger’s teeth that man and wife
Pericles	1	4	399	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.
Pericles	1	4	400	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping;
Pericles	1	4	401	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
Pericles	1	4	402	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
Pericles	1	4	403	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Is not this true?
Pericles	1	4	404	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
Pericles	1	4	405	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	O, let those cities that of Plenty’s cup

Pericles	1	4	415	speech	verse	LORDS.TARSUS.1_Per	A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
Pericles	1	4	416	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	I thought as much.

Pericles	1	4	418	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	That may succeed as his inheritor;

Pericles	1	4	420	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Taking advantage of our misery,
Pericles	1	4	421	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Hath stuffed the hollow vessels with their power

Pericles	1	4	423	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	And make a conquest of unhappy men,
Pericles	1	4	424	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Whereas no glory’s got to overcome.
Pericles	1	4	425	speech	verse	LORDS.TARSUS.1_Per	That’s the least fear, for, by the semblance
Pericles	1	4	426	speech	verse	LORDS.TARSUS.1_Per	Of their white flags displayed, they bring us peace
Pericles	1	4	427	speech	verse	LORDS.TARSUS.1_Per	And come to us as favorers, not as foes.

Pericles	2	3	713	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	He’s both their parent, and he is their grave,
Pericles	2	3	714	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And gives them what he will, not what they crave.

Pericles	2	3	716	speech	verse	KNIGHTS_Per	Who can be other in this royal presence?
Pericles	2	3	717	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	Here, with a cup that’s stored unto the brim,

Pericles	2	3	726	speech	verse	Thaisa_Per	What is ’t to me, my father?
Pericles	2	3	727	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	O, attend, my daughter. Princes in this
Pericles	2	3	728	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	Should live like gods above, who freely give
Pericles	2	3	729	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	To everyone that come to honor them.

Pericles	2	3	732	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	Therefore, to make his entrance more sweet,

Pericles	2	3	737	speech	verse	Thaisa_Per	He may my proffer take for an offense,
Pericles	2	3	738	speech	verse	Thaisa_Per	Since men take women’s gifts for impudence.
Pericles	2	3	739	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	How?

Pericles	2	3	763	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
Pericles	2	3	764	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	And will awake him from his melancholy.—
Pericles	2	3	765	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles

Pericles	2	3	768	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	Will well become a soldiers’ dance.
Pericles	2	3	769	speech	verse	Simonides_Per	I will not have excuse with saying this:

Pericles	4	1	1375	speech	verse	Leonine_Per	There’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead,
Pericles	4	1	1376	speech	verse	Leonine_Per	And thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further.
Pericles	4	1	1377	speech	verse	Leonine_Per	Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,

Pericles	4	2	1383	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Sir?
Pericles	4	2	1384	speech	prose	Pander_Per	Search the market narrowly. Mytilene is full of gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.
Pericles	4	2	1385	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
Pericles	4	2	1386	speech	prose	Pander_Per	Therefore let’s have fresh ones, whate’er we pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.
Pericles	4	2	1387	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Thou sayst true. ’Tis not our bringing up of poor bastards—as I think I have brought up some eleven—
Pericles	4	2	1388	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Ay, to eleven, and brought them down again. But shall I search the market?
Pericles	4	2	1389	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
Pericles	4	2	1390	speech	prose	Pander_Per	Thou sayst true. There’s two unwholesome, a’ conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead that lay with the little baggage.
Pericles	4	2	1391	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Ay, she quickly pooped him. She made him roast-meat for worms. But I’ll go search the market.
Pericles	4	2	1392	direction	exit	Bolt_Per	He exits.
Pericles	4	2	1393	speech	prose	Pander_Per	Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
Pericles	4	2	1394	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get when we are old?
Pericles	4	2	1395	speech	prose	Pander_Per	O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger. Therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, ’twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving o’er.
Pericles	4	2	1396	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Come, other sorts offend as well as we.
Pericles	4	2	1397	speech	prose	Pander_Per	As well as we? Ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is our profession any trade; it’s no calling. But here comes Bolt.

Pericles	4	2	1400	speech	prose	PIRATES.0.1_Per	O, sir, we doubt it not.
Pericles	4	2	1401	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Master, I have gone through for this piece you see. If you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.
Pericles	4	2	1402	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Bolt, has she any qualities?
Pericles	4	2	1403	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good clothes. There’s no farther necessity of qualities can make her be refused.
Pericles	4	2	1404	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	What’s her price, Bolt?
Pericles	4	2	1405	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
Pericles	4	2	1406	speech	prose	Pander_Per	Well, follow me, my masters; you shall have your money presently.—Wife, take her in. Instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her entertainment.

Pericles	4	2	1408	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Bolt, take you the marks of her: the color of her hair, complexion, height, her age, with warrant of her virginity, and cry “He that will give most shall have her first.” Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done as I command you.
Pericles	4	2	1409	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Performance shall follow.

Pericles	4	2	1411	speech	verse	Marina_Per	Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
Pericles	4	2	1412	speech	verse	Marina_Per	He should have struck, not spoke. Or that these pirates,
Pericles	4	2	1413	speech	verse	Marina_Per	Not enough barbarous, had but o’erboard thrown me
Pericles	4	2	1414	speech	verse	Marina_Per	For to seek my mother.
Pericles	4	2	1415	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Why lament you, pretty one?
Pericles	4	2	1416	speech	prose	Marina_Per	That I am pretty.
Pericles	4	2	1417	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Come, the gods have done their part in you.
Pericles	4	2	1418	speech	prose	Marina_Per	I accuse them not.
Pericles	4	2	1419	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.
Pericles	4	2	1420	speech	prose	Marina_Per	The more my fault, to ’scape his hands where I was to die.
Pericles	4	2	1421	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
Pericles	4	2	1422	speech	prose	Marina_Per	No.
Pericles	4	2	1423	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions. You shall fare well; you shall have the difference of all complexions. What, do you stop your ears?
Pericles	4	2	1424	speech	prose	Marina_Per	Are you a woman?
Pericles	4	2	1425	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?
Pericles	4	2	1426	speech	prose	Marina_Per	An honest woman, or not a woman.
Pericles	4	2	1427	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Marry, whip the gosling! I think I shall have something to do with you. Come, you’re a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have you.
Pericles	4	2	1428	speech	prose	Marina_Per	The gods defend me!
Pericles	4	2	1429	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you, men must feed you, men stir you up. Bolt’s returned.

Pericles	4	2	1431	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
Pericles	4	2	1432	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs. I have drawn her picture with my voice.
Pericles	4	2	1433	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
Pericles	4	2	1434	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father’s testament. There was a Spaniard’s mouth watered an he went to bed to her very description.
Pericles	4	2	1435	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on.
Pericles	4	2	1436	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Tonight, tonight! But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cowers i’ the hams?
Pericles	4	2	1437	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Who? Monsieur Verolles?
Pericles	4	2	1438	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Ay, he. He offered to cut a caper at the proclamation, but he made a groan at it and swore he would see her tomorrow.
Pericles	4	2	1439	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease hither; here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun.

Pericles	4	2	1441	direction	delivery	Bawd_Per	, to Marina
Pericles	4	2	1442	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you live as you do makes pity in your lovers. Seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
Pericles	4	2	1443	speech	prose	Marina_Per	I understand you not.
Pericles	4	2	1444	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	O, take her home, mistress, take her home! These blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice.
Pericles	4	2	1445	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Thou sayst true, i’ faith, so they must, for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant.
Pericles	4	2	1446	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Faith, some do and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for the joint—
Pericles	4	2	1447	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
Pericles	4	2	1448	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	I may so.
Pericles	4	2	1449	speech	prose	Bawd_Per	Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the manner of your garments well.
Pericles	4	2	1450	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.

Pericles	4	2	1454	speech	prose	Bolt_Per	I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclined. I’ll bring home some tonight.

Pericles	4	3	1466	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	I think you’ll turn a child again.
Pericles	4	3	1467	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
Pericles	4	3	1468	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	I’d give it to undo the deed. A lady

Pericles	4	3	1470	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	To equal any single crown o’ th’ Earth
Pericles	4	3	1471	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	I’ the justice of compare. O villain Leonine,

Pericles	4	3	1473	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	If thou hadst drunk to him, ’t had been a kindness

Pericles	4	3	1475	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
Pericles	4	3	1476	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	That she is dead. Nurses are not the Fates.
Pericles	4	3	1477	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	To foster is not ever to preserve.
Pericles	4	3	1478	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	She died at night; I’ll say so. Who can cross it
Pericles	4	3	1479	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Unless you play the impious innocent
Pericles	4	3	1480	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	And, for an honest attribute, cry out

Pericles	4	3	1482	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	O, go to. Well, well,
Pericles	4	3	1483	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
Pericles	4	3	1484	speech	verse	Cleon_Per	Do like this worst.
Pericles	4	3	1485	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Be one of those that thinks
Pericles	4	3	1486	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence
Pericles	4	3	1487	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	And open this to Pericles. I do shame
Pericles	4	3	1488	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	To think of what a noble strain you are,

Pericles	4	3	1494	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Be it so, then.
Pericles	4	3	1495	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
Pericles	4	3	1496	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
Pericles	4	3	1497	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	She did distain my child and stood between
Pericles	4	3	1498	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Her and her fortunes. None would look on her,

Pericles	4	3	1501	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through,

Pericles	4	3	1507	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	And as for Pericles,
Pericles	4	3	1508	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
Pericles	4	3	1509	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	And yet we mourn. Her monument is
Pericles	4	3	1510	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	Almost finished, and her epitaphs
Pericles	4	3	1511	speech	verse	Dionyza_Per	In glitt’ring golden characters express

Pericles	5	1	1920	speech	verse	Pericles_Per	And called Marina?
Pericles	5	1	1921	speech	verse	Marina_Per	You said you would believe me.
