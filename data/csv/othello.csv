Othello	1	1	1	direction	entrance	Iago_Oth	Enter Roderigo and Iago.
Othello	1	1	2	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly
Othello	1	1	3	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
Othello	1	1	4	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
Othello	1	1	5	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!
Othello	1	1	6	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If ever I did dream of such a matter,
Othello	1	1	7	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Abhor me.
Othello	1	1	8	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
Othello	1	1	9	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Despise me
Othello	1	1	10	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If I do not. Three great ones of the city,
Othello	1	1	11	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Othello	1	1	12	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Off-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,
Othello	1	1	13	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
Othello	1	1	14	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
Othello	1	1	15	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Evades them with a bombast circumstance,
Othello	1	1	16	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,
Othello	1	1	17	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And in conclusion,
Othello	1	1	18	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nonsuits my mediators. For “Certes,” says he,
Othello	1	1	19	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	“I have already chose my officer.”
Othello	1	1	20	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And what was he?
Othello	1	1	21	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
Othello	1	1	22	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
Othello	1	1	23	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	A fellow almost damned in a fair wife,
Othello	1	1	24	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That never set a squadron in the field,
Othello	1	1	25	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nor the division of a battle knows
Othello	1	1	26	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	More than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,
Othello	1	1	27	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Wherein the togèd consuls can propose
Othello	1	1	28	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice
Othello	1	1	29	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;
Othello	1	1	30	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
Othello	1	1	31	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds
Othello	1	1	32	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Christened and heathen, must be beleed and calmed
Othello	1	1	33	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	By debitor and creditor. This countercaster,
Othello	1	1	34	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
Othello	1	1	35	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.
Othello	1	1	36	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
Othello	1	1	37	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service.
Othello	1	1	38	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Preferment goes by letter and affection,
Othello	1	1	39	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And not by old gradation, where each second
Othello	1	1	40	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself
Othello	1	1	41	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Whether I in any just term am affined
Othello	1	1	42	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To love the Moor.
Othello	1	1	43	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	I would not follow him, then.
Othello	1	1	44	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	O, sir, content you.
Othello	1	1	45	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I follow him to serve my turn upon him.
Othello	1	1	46	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Othello	1	1	47	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark
Othello	1	1	48	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave
Othello	1	1	49	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
Othello	1	1	50	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,
Othello	1	1	51	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For naught but provender, and when he’s old, cashiered.
Othello	1	1	52	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Whip me such honest knaves! Others there are
Othello	1	1	53	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,
Othello	1	1	54	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
Othello	1	1	55	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Othello	1	1	56	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats,
Othello	1	1	57	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,
Othello	1	1	58	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
Othello	1	1	59	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Othello	1	1	60	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Were I the Moor I would not be Iago.
Othello	1	1	61	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In following him, I follow but myself.
Othello	1	1	62	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
Othello	1	1	63	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But seeming so for my peculiar end.
Othello	1	1	64	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For when my outward action doth demonstrate
Othello	1	1	65	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The native act and figure of my heart
Othello	1	1	66	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In complement extern, ’tis not long after
Othello	1	1	67	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
Othello	1	1	68	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.
Othello	1	1	69	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe
Othello	1	1	70	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	If he can carry ’t thus!
Othello	1	1	71	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Call up her father.
Othello	1	1	72	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Rouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,
Othello	1	1	73	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
Othello	1	1	74	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Othello	1	1	75	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,
Othello	1	1	76	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet throw such chances of vexation on ’t
Othello	1	1	77	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As it may lose some color.
Othello	1	1	78	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Here is her father’s house. I’ll call aloud.
Othello	1	1	79	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
Othello	1	1	80	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Othello	1	1	81	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is spied in populous cities.
Othello	1	1	82	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
Othello	1	1	83	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!
Othello	1	1	84	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Othello	1	1	85	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Thieves, thieves!
Othello	1	1	86	direction	entrance	Brabantio_Oth	Enter Brabantio, above.
Othello	1	1	87	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	What is the reason of this terrible summons?
Othello	1	1	88	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	What is the matter there?
Othello	1	1	89	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Signior, is all your family within?
Othello	1	1	90	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Are your doors locked?
Othello	1	1	91	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Why, wherefore ask you this?
Othello	1	1	92	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Zounds, sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your gown!
Othello	1	1	93	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Your heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.
Othello	1	1	94	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Othello	1	1	95	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!
Othello	1	1	96	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Othello	1	1	97	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
Othello	1	1	98	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Arise, I say!
Othello	1	1	99	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	What, have you lost your wits?
Othello	1	1	100	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
Othello	1	1	101	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Not I. What are you?
Othello	1	1	102	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	My name is Roderigo.
Othello	1	1	103	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	The worser welcome.
Othello	1	1	104	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
Othello	1	1	105	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
Othello	1	1	106	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	My daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,
Othello	1	1	107	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts,
Othello	1	1	108	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
Othello	1	1	109	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	To start my quiet.
Othello	1	1	110	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Sir, sir, sir—
Othello	1	1	111	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	But thou must needs be sure
Othello	1	1	112	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	My spirit and my place have in them power
Othello	1	1	113	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	To make this bitter to thee.
Othello	1	1	114	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Patience, good sir.
Othello	1	1	115	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	What tell’st thou me of robbing?
Othello	1	1	116	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	This is Venice. My house is not a grange.
Othello	1	1	117	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Most grave Brabantio,
Othello	1	1	118	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	In simple and pure soul I come to you—
Othello	1	1	119	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse, you’ll have your nephews neigh to you, you’ll have coursers for cousins and jennets for germans.
Othello	1	1	120	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	What profane wretch art thou?
Othello	1	1	121	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
Othello	1	1	122	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Thou art a villain.
Othello	1	1	123	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You are a senator.
Othello	1	1	124	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
Othello	1	1	125	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,
Othello	1	1	126	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	If ’t be your pleasure and most wise consent—
Othello	1	1	127	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	As partly I find it is—that your fair daughter,
Othello	1	1	128	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	At this odd-even and dull watch o’ th’ night,
Othello	1	1	129	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Transported with no worse nor better guard
Othello	1	1	130	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
Othello	1	1	131	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:
Othello	1	1	132	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	If this be known to you, and your allowance,
Othello	1	1	133	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.
Othello	1	1	134	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	But if you know not this, my manners tell me
Othello	1	1	135	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
Othello	1	1	136	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	That from the sense of all civility
Othello	1	1	137	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	I thus would play and trifle with your Reverence.
Othello	1	1	138	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
Othello	1	1	139	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	I say again, hath made a gross revolt,
Othello	1	1	140	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes
Othello	1	1	141	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Othello	1	1	142	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself.
Othello	1	1	143	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	If she be in her chamber or your house,
Othello	1	1	144	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Let loose on me the justice of the state
Othello	1	1	145	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	For thus deluding you.
Othello	1	1	146	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Strike on the tinder, ho!
Othello	1	1	147	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Give me a taper. Call up all my people.
Othello	1	1	148	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	This accident is not unlike my dream.
Othello	1	1	149	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Belief of it oppresses me already.
Othello	1	1	150	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Light, I say, light!

Othello	1	1	152	direction	delivery	Iago_Oth	, to Roderigo
Othello	1	1	153	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Farewell, for I must leave you.
Othello	1	1	154	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
Othello	1	1	155	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To be producted, as if I stay I shall,
Othello	1	1	156	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Against the Moor. For I do know the state,
Othello	1	1	157	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	However this may gall him with some check,
Othello	1	1	158	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embarked
Othello	1	1	159	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Othello	1	1	160	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,
Othello	1	1	161	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Another of his fathom they have none
Othello	1	1	162	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To lead their business. In which regard,
Othello	1	1	163	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,
Othello	1	1	164	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet, for necessity of present life,
Othello	1	1	165	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I must show out a flag and sign of love—
Othello	1	1	166	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Othello	1	1	167	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search,
Othello	1	1	168	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

Othello	1	1	171	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	It is too true an evil. Gone she is,
Othello	1	1	172	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	And what’s to come of my despisèd time
Othello	1	1	173	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Is naught but bitterness.—Now, Roderigo,
Othello	1	1	174	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Where didst thou see her?—O, unhappy girl!—
Othello	1	1	175	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	With the Moor, sayst thou?—Who would be a father?—
Othello	1	1	176	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	How didst thou know ’twas she?—O, she deceives me
Othello	1	1	177	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more tapers.
Othello	1	1	178	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Raise all my kindred.—Are they married, think you?
Othello	1	1	179	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Truly, I think they are.
Othello	1	1	180	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Othello	1	1	181	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds
Othello	1	1	182	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	By what you see them act.—Is there not charms
Othello	1	1	183	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	By which the property of youth and maidhood
Othello	1	1	184	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Othello	1	1	185	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Of some such thing?
Othello	1	1	186	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Othello	1	1	187	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Call up my brother.—O, would you had had her!—
Othello	1	1	188	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Some one way, some another.—Do you know
Othello	1	1	189	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
Othello	1	1	190	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	I think I can discover him, if you please
Othello	1	1	191	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	To get good guard and go along with me.
Othello	1	1	192	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call.
Othello	1	1	193	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I may command at most.—Get weapons, ho!
Othello	1	1	194	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	And raise some special officers of night.—

Othello	1	2	199	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience
Othello	1	2	200	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity
Othello	1	2	201	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times
Othello	1	2	202	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I had thought t’ have yerked him here under the ribs.
Othello	1	2	203	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Tis better as it is.
Othello	1	2	204	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nay, but he prated
Othello	1	2	205	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Othello	1	2	206	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Against your Honor,
Othello	1	2	207	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That with the little godliness I have
Othello	1	2	208	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,

Othello	1	2	210	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That the magnifico is much beloved,
Othello	1	2	211	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And hath in his effect a voice potential
Othello	1	2	212	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you

Othello	1	2	217	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	My services which I have done the signiory
Othello	1	2	218	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know
Othello	1	2	219	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,
Othello	1	2	220	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being
Othello	1	2	221	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	From men of royal siege, and my demerits
Othello	1	2	222	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
Othello	1	2	223	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,
Othello	1	2	224	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
Othello	1	2	225	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I would not my unhousèd free condition
Othello	1	2	226	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Put into circumscription and confine

Othello	1	2	241	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What is the matter, think you?

Othello	1	2	243	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	It is a business of some heat. The galleys

Othello	1	2	250	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	To search you out.

Othello	1	2	257	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.
Othello	1	2	258	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	I do not understand.

Othello	1	2	275	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Good signior, you shall more command with years
Othello	1	2	276	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Than with your weapons.
Othello	1	2	277	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	O, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter?
Othello	1	2	278	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!
Othello	1	2	279	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,
Othello	1	2	280	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Othello	1	2	281	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,

Othello	1	2	283	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	The wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation,
Othello	1	2	284	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Would ever have, t’ incur a general mock,
Othello	1	2	285	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Othello	1	2	286	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight!
Othello	1	2	287	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense
Othello	1	2	288	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,
Othello	1	2	289	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
Othello	1	2	290	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	That weakens motion. I’ll have ’t disputed on.
Othello	1	2	291	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
Othello	1	2	292	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
Othello	1	2	293	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	For an abuser of the world, a practicer
Othello	1	2	294	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.—
Othello	1	2	295	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,
Othello	1	2	296	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Subdue him at his peril.

Othello	1	2	298	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Both you of my inclining and the rest.
Othello	1	2	299	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it

Othello	1	2	310	speech	verse	OFFICERS_Oth	’Tis true, most worthy signior.
Othello	1	2	311	speech	verse	OFFICERS_Oth	The Duke’s in council, and your noble self
Othello	1	2	312	speech	verse	OFFICERS_Oth	I am sure is sent for.
Othello	1	2	313	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	How? The Duke in council?

Othello	1	2	315	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,
Othello	1	2	316	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Or any of my brothers of the state,
Othello	1	2	317	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.
Othello	1	2	318	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	For if such actions may have passage free,

Othello	1	3	355	speech	verse	SENATORS.0.1_Oth	So may he with more facile question bear it,
Othello	1	3	356	speech	verse	SENATORS.0.1_Oth	For that it stands not in such warlike brace,

Othello	1	3	421	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,
Othello	1	3	422	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	It is most true; true I have married her.
Othello	1	3	423	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The very head and front of my offending
Othello	1	3	424	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
Othello	1	3	425	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;
Othello	1	3	426	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,

Othello	1	3	428	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Their dearest action in the tented field,
Othello	1	3	429	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And little of this great world can I speak
Othello	1	3	430	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.
Othello	1	3	431	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And therefore little shall I grace my cause
Othello	1	3	432	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,

Othello	1	3	436	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	(For such proceeding I am charged withal)

Othello	1	3	439	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
Othello	1	3	440	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Blushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,

Othello	1	3	442	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	To fall in love with what she feared to look on!
Othello	1	3	443	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect
Othello	1	3	444	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	That will confess perfection so could err
Othello	1	3	445	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
Othello	1	3	446	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	To find out practices of cunning hell
Othello	1	3	447	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again

Othello	1	3	451	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	To vouch this is no proof
Othello	1	3	452	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Without more wider and more overt test
Othello	1	3	453	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Othello	1	3	454	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

Othello	1	3	474	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And she in mine.
Othello	1	3	475	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Say it, Othello.
Othello	1	3	476	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Her father loved me, oft invited me,
Othello	1	3	477	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Still questioned me the story of my life
Othello	1	3	478	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes
Othello	1	3	479	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That I have passed.
Othello	1	3	480	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I ran it through, even from my boyish days
Othello	1	3	481	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To th’ very moment that he bade me tell it,
Othello	1	3	482	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
Othello	1	3	483	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Othello	1	3	484	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of hairbreadth ’scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach,
Othello	1	3	485	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of being taken by the insolent foe
Othello	1	3	486	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,
Othello	1	3	487	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And portance in my traveler’s history,
Othello	1	3	488	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Othello	1	3	489	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
Othello	1	3	490	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	It was my hint to speak—such was my process—
Othello	1	3	491	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And of the cannibals that each other eat,
Othello	1	3	492	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
Othello	1	3	493	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to hear
Othello	1	3	494	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Would Desdemona seriously incline.
Othello	1	3	495	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
Othello	1	3	496	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch
Othello	1	3	497	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She’d come again, and with a greedy ear
Othello	1	3	498	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Devour up my discourse. Which I, observing,
Othello	1	3	499	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
Othello	1	3	500	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
Othello	1	3	501	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Othello	1	3	502	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
Othello	1	3	503	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But not intentively. I did consent,
Othello	1	3	504	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And often did beguile her of her tears
Othello	1	3	505	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	When I did speak of some distressful stroke
Othello	1	3	506	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That my youth suffered. My story being done,
Othello	1	3	507	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.
Othello	1	3	508	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange,
Othello	1	3	509	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.
Othello	1	3	510	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished
Othello	1	3	511	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked me,
Othello	1	3	512	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
Othello	1	3	513	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I should but teach him how to tell my story,
Othello	1	3	514	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.
Othello	1	3	515	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She loved me for the dangers I had passed,
Othello	1	3	516	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And I loved her that she did pity them.
Othello	1	3	517	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	This only is the witchcraft I have used.
Othello	1	3	518	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.
Othello	1	3	519	direction	entrance	Desdemona_Oth	Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.
Othello	1	3	519	direction	entrance	Iago_Oth	Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.
Othello	1	3	519	direction	entrance	OFFICERS.0_Oth	Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.
Othello	1	3	520	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	I think this tale would win my daughter, too.
Othello	1	3	521	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Good Brabantio,
Othello	1	3	522	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Take up this mangled matter at the best.
Othello	1	3	523	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Men do their broken weapons rather use
Othello	1	3	524	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Than their bare hands.
Othello	1	3	525	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I pray you hear her speak.
Othello	1	3	526	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Othello	1	3	527	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Destruction on my head if my bad blame
Othello	1	3	528	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Light on the man.—Come hither, gentle mistress.
Othello	1	3	529	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Do you perceive in all this noble company
Othello	1	3	530	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Where most you owe obedience?
Othello	1	3	531	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My noble father,
Othello	1	3	532	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I do perceive here a divided duty.
Othello	1	3	533	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To you I am bound for life and education.
Othello	1	3	534	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My life and education both do learn me
Othello	1	3	535	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	How to respect you. You are the lord of duty.
Othello	1	3	536	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my husband.
Othello	1	3	537	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And so much duty as my mother showed
Othello	1	3	538	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To you, preferring you before her father,
Othello	1	3	539	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	So much I challenge that I may profess
Othello	1	3	540	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Due to the Moor my lord.
Othello	1	3	541	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	God be with you! I have done.
Othello	1	3	542	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs.
Othello	1	3	543	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I had rather to adopt a child than get it.—
Othello	1	3	544	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Come hither, Moor.
Othello	1	3	545	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I here do give thee that with all my heart
Othello	1	3	546	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
Othello	1	3	547	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,
Othello	1	3	548	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I am glad at soul I have no other child,
Othello	1	3	549	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
Othello	1	3	550	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.
Othello	1	3	551	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,
Othello	1	3	552	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Which as a grise or step may help these lovers
Othello	1	3	553	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Into your favor.
Othello	1	3	554	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
Othello	1	3	555	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
Othello	1	3	556	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Othello	1	3	557	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
Othello	1	3	558	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,
Othello	1	3	559	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Patience her injury a mock’ry makes.
Othello	1	3	560	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief;
Othello	1	3	561	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
Othello	1	3	562	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,
Othello	1	3	563	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	We lose it not so long as we can smile.
Othello	1	3	564	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
Othello	1	3	565	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
Othello	1	3	566	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
Othello	1	3	567	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
Othello	1	3	568	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	These sentences to sugar or to gall,
Othello	1	3	569	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.
Othello	1	3	570	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	But words are words. I never yet did hear
Othello	1	3	571	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	That the bruised heart was piercèd through the ear.
Othello	1	3	572	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I humbly beseech you, proceed to th’ affairs of state.
Othello	1	3	573	speech	prose	Duke_Oth	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boist’rous expedition.
Othello	1	3	574	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Othello	1	3	575	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
Othello	1	3	576	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize
Othello	1	3	577	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A natural and prompt alacrity
Othello	1	3	578	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I find in hardness, and do undertake
Othello	1	3	579	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	This present wars against the Ottomites.
Othello	1	3	580	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,
Othello	1	3	581	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I crave fit disposition for my wife,
Othello	1	3	582	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Due reference of place and exhibition,
Othello	1	3	583	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	With such accommodation and besort
Othello	1	3	584	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As levels with her breeding.
Othello	1	3	585	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Why, at her father’s.
Othello	1	3	586	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	I will not have it so.
Othello	1	3	587	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Nor I.
Othello	1	3	588	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Nor would I there reside
Othello	1	3	589	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To put my father in impatient thoughts
Othello	1	3	590	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
Othello	1	3	591	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
Othello	1	3	592	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And let me find a charter in your voice
Othello	1	3	593	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	T’ assist my simpleness.
Othello	1	3	594	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	What would you, Desdemona?
Othello	1	3	595	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	That I love the Moor to live with him
Othello	1	3	596	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My downright violence and storm of fortunes
Othello	1	3	597	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	May trumpet to the world. My heart’s subdued
Othello	1	3	598	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Even to the very quality of my lord.
Othello	1	3	599	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,
Othello	1	3	600	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And to his honors and his valiant parts
Othello	1	3	601	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
Othello	1	3	602	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
Othello	1	3	603	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
Othello	1	3	604	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	The rites for why I love him are bereft me
Othello	1	3	605	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And I a heavy interim shall support
Othello	1	3	606	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
Othello	1	3	607	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Let her have your voice.
Othello	1	3	608	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not
Othello	1	3	609	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To please the palate of my appetite,
Othello	1	3	610	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Nor to comply with heat (the young affects
Othello	1	3	611	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In me defunct) and proper satisfaction,
Othello	1	3	612	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But to be free and bounteous to her mind.
Othello	1	3	613	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And heaven defend your good souls that you think
Othello	1	3	614	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I will your serious and great business scant
Othello	1	3	615	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For she is with me. No, when light-winged toys
Othello	1	3	616	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness
Othello	1	3	617	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	My speculative and officed instruments,
Othello	1	3	618	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
Othello	1	3	619	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
Othello	1	3	620	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And all indign and base adversities
Othello	1	3	621	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Make head against my estimation.
Othello	1	3	622	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Be it as you shall privately determine,
Othello	1	3	623	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Either for her stay or going. Th’ affair cries haste,
Othello	1	3	624	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	And speed must answer it.
Othello	1	3	625	speech	verse	SENATORS.0.1_Oth	You must away tonight.
Othello	1	3	626	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	With all my heart.
Othello	1	3	627	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	At nine i’ th’ morning here we’ll meet again.
Othello	1	3	628	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Othello, leave some officer behind
Othello	1	3	629	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	And he shall our commission bring to you,
Othello	1	3	630	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	With such things else of quality and respect
Othello	1	3	631	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	As doth import you.
Othello	1	3	632	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	So please your Grace, my ancient.
Othello	1	3	633	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A man he is of honesty and trust.
Othello	1	3	634	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To his conveyance I assign my wife,
Othello	1	3	635	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	With what else needful your good Grace shall think
Othello	1	3	636	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To be sent after me.
Othello	1	3	637	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Let it be so.
Othello	1	3	638	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Good night to everyone. And, noble signior,
Othello	1	3	639	direction	delivery	Duke_Oth	To Brabantio.
Othello	1	3	640	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Othello	1	3	641	speech	verse	Duke_Oth	Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
Othello	1	3	642	speech	verse	SENATORS.0.1_Oth	Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
Othello	1	3	643	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.
Othello	1	3	644	speech	verse	Brabantio_Oth	She has deceived her father, and may thee.
Othello	1	3	645	direction	exit	Brabantio_Oth	He exits.
Othello	1	3	646	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	My life upon her faith!
Othello	1	3	647	direction	exit	Duke_Oth	The Duke, the Senators, Cassio, and Officers exit.
Othello	1	3	647	direction	exit	SENATORS_Oth	The Duke, the Senators, Cassio, and Officers exit.

Othello	1	3	647	direction	exit	OFFICERS_Oth	The Duke, the Senators, Cassio, and Officers exit.
Othello	1	3	648	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Honest Iago,
Othello	1	3	649	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
Othello	1	3	650	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I prithee let thy wife attend on her,
Othello	1	3	651	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And bring them after in the best advantage.—
Othello	1	3	652	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour
Othello	1	3	653	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of love, of worldly matters, and direction
Othello	1	3	654	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
Othello	1	3	655	direction	exit	Othello_Oth	Othello and Desdemona exit.
Othello	1	3	655	direction	exit	Desdemona_Oth	Othello and Desdemona exit.
Othello	1	3	656	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Iago—
Othello	1	3	657	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	What sayst thou, noble heart?
Othello	1	3	658	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	What will I do, think’st thou?
Othello	1	3	659	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Why, go to bed and sleep.
Othello	1	3	660	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I will incontinently drown myself.
Othello	1	3	661	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!
Othello	1	3	662	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	It is silliness to live, when to live is torment, and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
Othello	1	3	663	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
Othello	1	3	664	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
Othello	1	3	665	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts— whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or scion.
Othello	1	3	666	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	It cannot be.
Othello	1	3	667	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse. Follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse— nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration —put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice. Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her. Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.
Othello	1	3	668	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?
Othello	1	3	669	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.
Othello	1	3	670	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Where shall we meet i’ th’ morning?
Othello	1	3	671	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	At my lodging.
Othello	1	3	672	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I’ll be with thee betimes.
Othello	1	3	673	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
Othello	1	3	674	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	What say you?
Othello	1	3	675	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	No more of drowning, do you hear?
Othello	1	3	676	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I am changed.
Othello	1	3	677	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your purse.
Othello	1	3	678	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I’ll sell all my land.
Othello	1	3	679	direction	exit	Roderigo_Oth	He exits.
Othello	1	3	680	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.
Othello	1	3	681	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For I mine own gained knowledge should profane
Othello	1	3	682	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If I would time expend with such a snipe
Othello	1	3	683	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,
Othello	1	3	684	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets
Othello	1	3	685	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	’Has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,
Othello	1	3	686	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Othello	1	3	687	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Will do as if for surety. He holds me well.
Othello	1	3	688	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The better shall my purpose work on him.
Othello	1	3	689	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now:
Othello	1	3	690	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To get his place and to plume up my will
Othello	1	3	691	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In double knavery—How? how?—Let’s see.
Othello	1	3	692	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear
Othello	1	3	693	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That he is too familiar with his wife.
Othello	1	3	694	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	He hath a person and a smooth dispose
Othello	1	3	695	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To be suspected, framed to make women false.
Othello	1	3	696	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The Moor is of a free and open nature

I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, ’tis so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed; an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? Would they were clyster pipes for your sake!

Othello	2	1	930	direction	delivery	Iago_Oth	, to a departing Attendant
Othello	2	1	931	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou be’st valiant—as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them—list me. The Lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
Othello	2	1	932	direction	delivery	Iago_Oth	To Roderigo.
Othello	2	1	933	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	With him? Why, ’tis not possible.
Othello	2	1	934	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.
Othello	2	1	935	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I cannot believe that in her. She’s full of most blessed condition.
Othello	2	1	936	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Blessed fig’s end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?
Othello	2	1	937	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Yes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.
Othello	2	1	938	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’ incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight. For the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.
Othello	2	1	939	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Well.
Othello	2	1	940	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
Othello	2	1	941	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.
Othello	2	1	942	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
Othello	2	1	943	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Adieu.
Othello	2	1	944	direction	exit	Roderigo_Oth	He exits.
Othello	2	1	945	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.
Othello	2	1	946	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.
Othello	2	1	947	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Othello	2	1	948	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
Othello	2	1	949	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona
Othello	2	1	950	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
Othello	2	1	951	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure
Othello	2	1	952	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I stand accountant for as great a sin)
Othello	2	1	953	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But partly led to diet my revenge
Othello	2	1	954	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Othello	2	1	955	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Hath leaped into my seat—the thought whereof
Othello	2	1	956	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,
Othello	2	1	957	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And nothing can or shall content my soul
Othello	2	1	958	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Till I am evened with him, wife for wife,
Othello	2	1	959	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor
Othello	2	1	960	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	At least into a jealousy so strong
Othello	2	1	961	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
Othello	2	1	962	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace
Othello	2	1	963	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
Othello	2	1	964	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Othello	2	1	965	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
Othello	2	1	966	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),
Othello	2	1	967	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
Othello	2	1	968	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For making him egregiously an ass
Othello	2	1	969	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And practicing upon his peace and quiet
Othello	2	1	970	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Even to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confused.

For besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial.

Othello	2	3	994	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	She’s a most exquisite lady.
Othello	2	3	995	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.

Othello	2	3	1002	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.
Othello	2	3	1003	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	O, they are our friends! But one cup; I’ll drink for you.
Othello	2	3	1004	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more.

Othello	2	3	1038	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.
Othello	2	3	1039	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Is your Englishman so exquisite in his drinking?
Othello	2	3	1040	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain. He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.

Othello	2	3	1050	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And thou art but of low degree;
Othello	2	3	1051	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	’Tis pride that pulls the country down,

Othello	2	3	1060	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let’s have no more of this. Let’s to our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
Othello	2	3	1061	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN_Oth	Excellent well.

Othello	2	3	1131	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that
Othello	2	3	1132	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
Othello	2	3	1133	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!
Othello	2	3	1134	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Othello	2	3	1135	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Othello	2	3	1136	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle
Othello	2	3	1137	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
Othello	2	3	1138	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,
Othello	2	3	1139	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.
Othello	2	3	1140	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,
Othello	2	3	1141	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In quarter and in terms like bride and groom
Othello	2	3	1142	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Divesting them for bed; and then but now,
Othello	2	3	1143	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As if some planet had unwitted men,
Othello	2	3	1144	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,
Othello	2	3	1145	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
Othello	2	3	1146	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Any beginning to this peevish odds,
Othello	2	3	1147	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And would in action glorious I had lost
Othello	2	3	1148	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
Othello	2	3	1149	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
Othello	2	3	1150	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.
Othello	2	3	1151	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.
Othello	2	3	1152	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The gravity and stillness of your youth
Othello	2	3	1153	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The world hath noted. And your name is great
Othello	2	3	1154	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter
Othello	2	3	1155	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That you unlace your reputation thus,
Othello	2	3	1156	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And spend your rich opinion for the name
Othello	2	3	1157	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.
Othello	2	3	1158	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
Othello	2	3	1159	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	Your officer Iago can inform you,
Othello	2	3	1160	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	While I spare speech, which something now offends me,
Othello	2	3	1161	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
Othello	2	3	1162	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	By me that’s said or done amiss this night,
Othello	2	3	1163	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
Othello	2	3	1164	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	And to defend ourselves it be a sin
Othello	2	3	1165	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	When violence assails us.
Othello	2	3	1166	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Now, by heaven,
Othello	2	3	1167	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	My blood begins my safer guides to rule,
Othello	2	3	1168	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And passion, having my best judgment collied,
Othello	2	3	1169	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,
Othello	2	3	1170	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Othello	2	3	1171	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
Othello	2	3	1172	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	How this foul rout began, who set it on;
Othello	2	3	1173	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And he that is approved in this offense,
Othello	2	3	1174	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,
Othello	2	3	1175	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Shall lose me. What, in a town of war
Othello	2	3	1176	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,
Othello	2	3	1177	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To manage private and domestic quarrel,
Othello	2	3	1178	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In night, and on the court and guard of safety?
Othello	2	3	1179	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began ’t?
Othello	2	3	1180	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	If partially affined, or leagued in office,
Othello	2	3	1181	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
Othello	2	3	1182	speech	verse	Montano_Oth	Thou art no soldier.
Othello	2	3	1183	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Touch me not so near.
Othello	2	3	1184	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Othello	2	3	1185	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio.
Othello	2	3	1186	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Othello	2	3	1187	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:
Othello	2	3	1188	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Montano and myself being in speech,
Othello	2	3	1189	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	There comes a fellow crying out for help,
Othello	2	3	1190	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And Cassio following him with determined sword
Othello	2	3	1191	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
Othello	2	3	1192	direction	business	Iago_Oth	Pointing to Montano.
Othello	2	3	1193	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.
Othello	2	3	1194	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Othello	2	3	1195	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out—
Othello	2	3	1196	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,
Othello	2	3	1197	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather
Othello	2	3	1198	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
Othello	2	3	1199	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight
Othello	2	3	1200	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I ne’er might say before. When I came back—
Othello	2	3	1201	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For this was brief—I found them close together
Othello	2	3	1202	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	At blow and thrust, even as again they were
Othello	2	3	1203	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	When you yourself did part them.
Othello	2	3	1204	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	More of this matter cannot I report.
Othello	2	3	1205	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
Othello	2	3	1206	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
Othello	2	3	1207	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Othello	2	3	1208	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
Othello	2	3	1209	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	From him that fled some strange indignity
Othello	2	3	1210	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which patience could not pass.
Othello	2	3	1211	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I know, Iago,
Othello	2	3	1212	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
Othello	2	3	1213	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Making it light to Cassio.—Cassio, I love thee,

Othello	2	3	1217	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’ll make thee an example.
Othello	2	3	1218	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	What is the matter, dear?
Othello	2	3	1219	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	All’s well now, sweeting.

Othello	2	3	1224	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Iago, look with care about the town
Othello	2	3	1225	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.—
Othello	2	3	1226	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Come, Desdemona. ’Tis the soldier’s life
Othello	2	3	1227	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
Othello	2	3	1228	direction	exit	Othello_Oth	All but Iago and Cassio exit.

Othello	2	3	1229	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Othello	2	3	1230	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Ay, past all surgery.
Othello	2	3	1231	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Marry, God forbid!
Othello	2	3	1232	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
Othello	2	3	1233	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound. There is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the General again! You are but now cast in his mood—a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.
Othello	2	3	1234	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!
Othello	2	3	1235	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?
Othello	2	3	1236	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I know not.
Othello	2	3	1237	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Is ’t possible?
Othello	2	3	1238	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform ourselves into beasts!
Othello	2	3	1239	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus recovered?
Othello	2	3	1240	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
Othello	2	3	1241	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
Othello	2	3	1242	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil.
Othello	2	3	1243	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
Othello	2	3	1244	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!
Othello	2	3	1245	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general: I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
Othello	2	3	1246	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	You advise me well.
Othello	2	3	1247	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
Othello	2	3	1248	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.
Othello	2	3	1249	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I must to the watch.
Othello	2	3	1250	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Good night, honest Iago.
Othello	2	3	1251	direction	exit	Cassio_Oth	Cassio exits.
Othello	2	3	1252	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And what’s he, then, that says I play the villain,
Othello	2	3	1253	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	When this advice is free I give and honest,
Othello	2	3	1254	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
Othello	2	3	1255	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy
Othello	2	3	1256	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue
Othello	2	3	1257	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitful
Othello	2	3	1258	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As the free elements. And then for her
Othello	2	3	1259	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To win the Moor—were ’t to renounce his baptism,
Othello	2	3	1260	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin—
Othello	2	3	1261	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	His soul is so enfettered to her love
Othello	2	3	1262	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Othello	2	3	1263	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Even as her appetite shall play the god
Othello	2	3	1264	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	With his weak function. How am I then a villain
Othello	2	3	1265	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
Othello	2	3	1266	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
Othello	2	3	1267	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	When devils will the blackest sins put on,
Othello	2	3	1268	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
Othello	2	3	1269	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
Othello	2	3	1270	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
Othello	2	3	1271	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
Othello	2	3	1272	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear:
Othello	2	3	1273	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That she repeals him for her body’s lust;
Othello	2	3	1274	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And by how much she strives to do him good,
Othello	2	3	1275	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
Othello	2	3	1276	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
Othello	2	3	1277	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And out of her own goodness make the net
Othello	2	3	1278	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That shall enmesh them all.

Othello	2	3	1280	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	How now, Roderigo?
Othello	2	3	1281	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
Othello	2	3	1282	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	How poor are they that have not patience!
Othello	2	3	1283	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Othello	2	3	1284	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
Othello	2	3	1285	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And wit depends on dilatory time.
Othello	2	3	1286	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Does 't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
Othello	2	3	1287	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.
Othello	2	3	1288	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Othello	2	3	1289	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Othello	2	3	1290	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Content thyself awhile. By th’ Mass, ’tis morning!
Othello	2	3	1291	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Othello	2	3	1292	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
Othello	2	3	1293	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.

Othello	3	1	1349	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
Othello	3	1	1350	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
Othello	3	1	1351	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves you
Othello	3	1	1352	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And needs no other suitor but his likings
Othello	3	1	1353	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	To take the safest occasion by the front
Othello	3	1	1354	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	To bring you in again.
Othello	3	1	1355	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Yet I beseech you,
Othello	3	1	1356	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Othello	3	1	1357	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Give me advantage of some brief discourse
Othello	3	1	1358	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	With Desdemon alone.
Othello	3	1	1359	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Pray you come in.
Othello	3	1	1360	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I will bestow you where you shall have time
Othello	3	1	1361	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	To speak your bosom freely.

Othello	3	3	1377	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband
Othello	3	3	1378	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	As if the cause were his.
Othello	3	3	1379	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	O, that’s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,
Othello	3	3	1380	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	But I will have my lord and you again
Othello	3	3	1381	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	As friendly as you were.
Othello	3	3	1382	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Bounteous madam,
Othello	3	3	1383	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
Othello	3	3	1384	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	He’s never anything but your true servant.
Othello	3	3	1385	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I know ’t. I thank you. You do love my lord;

Othello	3	3	1387	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Othello	3	3	1388	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Than in a politic distance.
Othello	3	3	1389	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Ay, but, lady,
Othello	3	3	1390	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	That policy may either last so long,
Othello	3	3	1391	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Othello	3	3	1392	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
Othello	3	3	1393	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	That, I being absent and my place supplied,
Othello	3	3	1394	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	My general will forget my love and service.
Othello	3	3	1395	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here,
Othello	3	3	1396	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
Othello	3	3	1397	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it
Othello	3	3	1398	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To the last article. My lord shall never rest:
Othello	3	3	1399	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
Othello	3	3	1400	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
Othello	3	3	1401	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I’ll intermingle everything he does
Othello	3	3	1402	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,
Othello	3	3	1403	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	For thy solicitor shall rather die

Othello	3	3	1408	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why, stay, and hear me speak.
Othello	3	3	1409	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,
Othello	3	3	1410	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Unfit for mine own purposes.
Othello	3	3	1411	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Well, do your discretion.

Othello	3	3	1413	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Ha, I like not that.
Othello	3	3	1414	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What dost thou say?
Othello	3	3	1415	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.
Othello	3	3	1416	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
Othello	3	3	1417	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it
Othello	3	3	1418	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That he would steal away so guiltylike,
Othello	3	3	1419	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Seeing your coming.
Othello	3	3	1420	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I do believe ’twas he.
Othello	3	3	1421	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	How now, my lord?
Othello	3	3	1422	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I have been talking with a suitor here,
Othello	3	3	1423	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	A man that languishes in your displeasure.
Othello	3	3	1424	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Who is ’t you mean?
Othello	3	3	1425	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
Othello	3	3	1426	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If I have any grace or power to move you,
Othello	3	3	1427	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	His present reconciliation take;
Othello	3	3	1428	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	For if he be not one that truly loves you,
Othello	3	3	1429	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
Othello	3	3	1430	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I have no judgment in an honest face.
Othello	3	3	1431	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I prithee call him back.
Othello	3	3	1432	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Went he hence now?
Othello	3	3	1433	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Yes, faith, so humbled
Othello	3	3	1434	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	That he hath left part of his grief with me
Othello	3	3	1435	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
Othello	3	3	1436	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.
Othello	3	3	1437	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	But shall ’t be shortly?
Othello	3	3	1438	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The sooner, sweet, for you.
Othello	3	3	1439	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Shall ’t be tonight at supper?
Othello	3	3	1440	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	No, not tonight.
Othello	3	3	1441	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Tomorrow dinner, then?
Othello	3	3	1442	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I shall not dine at home;
Othello	3	3	1443	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I meet the captains at the citadel.
Othello	3	3	1444	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,
Othello	3	3	1445	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.
Othello	3	3	1446	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I prithee name the time, but let it not
Othello	3	3	1447	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;
Othello	3	3	1448	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And yet his trespass, in our common reason—
Othello	3	3	1449	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Save that, they say, the wars must make example
Othello	3	3	1450	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Out of her best—is not almost a fault
Othello	3	3	1451	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?
Othello	3	3	1452	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul
Othello	3	3	1453	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	What you would ask me that I should deny,
Othello	3	3	1454	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Or stand so mamm’ring on? What? Michael Cassio,
Othello	3	3	1455	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
Othello	3	3	1456	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Othello	3	3	1457	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Hath ta’en your part—to have so much to do
Othello	3	3	1458	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To bring him in! By ’r Lady, I could do much—
Othello	3	3	1459	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
Othello	3	3	1460	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I will deny thee nothing.
Othello	3	3	1461	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why, this is not a boon!
Othello	3	3	1462	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Othello	3	3	1463	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Othello	3	3	1464	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
Othello	3	3	1465	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit
Othello	3	3	1466	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
Othello	3	3	1467	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
Othello	3	3	1468	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And fearful to be granted.
Othello	3	3	1469	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I will deny thee nothing!
Othello	3	3	1470	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
Othello	3	3	1471	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To leave me but a little to myself.
Othello	3	3	1472	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
Othello	3	3	1473	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.
Othello	3	3	1474	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you.
Othello	3	3	1475	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Whate’er you be, I am obedient.
Othello	3	3	1476	direction	exit	Desdemona_Oth	Desdemona and Emilia exit.
Othello	3	3	1476	direction	exit	Emilia_Oth	Desdemona and Emilia exit.
Othello	3	3	1477	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul
Othello	3	3	1478	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,
Othello	3	3	1479	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Chaos is come again.
Othello	3	3	1480	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My noble lord—
Othello	3	3	1481	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What dost thou say, Iago?
Othello	3	3	1482	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Did Michael Cassio,
Othello	3	3	1483	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	When you wooed my lady, know of your love?
Othello	3	3	1484	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
Othello	3	3	1485	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But for a satisfaction of my thought,
Othello	3	3	1486	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	No further harm.
Othello	3	3	1487	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Why of thy thought, Iago?
Othello	3	3	1488	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
Othello	3	3	1489	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O yes, and went between us very oft.
Othello	3	3	1490	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Indeed?
Othello	3	3	1491	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?
Othello	3	3	1492	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Is he not honest?
Othello	3	3	1493	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Honest, my lord?
Othello	3	3	1494	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Honest—ay, honest.
Othello	3	3	1495	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My lord, for aught I know.
Othello	3	3	1496	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What dost thou think?
Othello	3	3	1497	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Think, my lord?
Othello	3	3	1498	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	“Think, my lord?” By heaven, thou echo’st me
Othello	3	3	1499	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As if there were some monster in thy thought
Othello	3	3	1500	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.
Othello	3	3	1501	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,
Othello	3	3	1502	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?
Othello	3	3	1503	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And when I told thee he was of my counsel
Othello	3	3	1504	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?”
Othello	3	3	1505	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And didst contract and purse thy brow together
Othello	3	3	1506	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Othello	3	3	1507	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
Othello	3	3	1508	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Show me thy thought.
Othello	3	3	1509	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My lord, you know I love you.
Othello	3	3	1510	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I think thou dost;
Othello	3	3	1511	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty
Othello	3	3	1512	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,
Othello	3	3	1513	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.
Othello	3	3	1514	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For such things in a false, disloyal knave
Othello	3	3	1515	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,
Othello	3	3	1516	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	They’re close dilations working from the heart
Othello	3	3	1517	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That passion cannot rule.
Othello	3	3	1518	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For Michael Cassio,
Othello	3	3	1519	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
Othello	3	3	1520	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I think so too.
Othello	3	3	1521	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Men should be what they seem;
Othello	3	3	1522	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
Othello	3	3	1523	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Certain, men should be what they seem.
Othello	3	3	1524	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
Othello	3	3	1525	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Nay, yet there’s more in this.
Othello	3	3	1526	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,
Othello	3	3	1527	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
Othello	3	3	1528	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The worst of words.
Othello	3	3	1529	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Good my lord, pardon me.
Othello	3	3	1530	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Though I am bound to every act of duty,
Othello	3	3	1531	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Othello	3	3	1532	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false—
Othello	3	3	1533	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As where’s that palace whereinto foul things
Othello	3	3	1534	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure
Othello	3	3	1535	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But some uncleanly apprehensions
Othello	3	3	1536	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit
Othello	3	3	1537	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	With meditations lawful?
Othello	3	3	1538	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
Othello	3	3	1539	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear
Othello	3	3	1540	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A stranger to thy thoughts.
Othello	3	3	1541	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I do beseech you,
Othello	3	3	1542	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess—
Othello	3	3	1543	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague
Othello	3	3	1544	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Othello	3	3	1545	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom
Othello	3	3	1546	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	From one that so imperfectly conceits
Othello	3	3	1547	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Othello	3	3	1548	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
Othello	3	3	1549	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Othello	3	3	1550	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,
Othello	3	3	1551	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To let you know my thoughts.
Othello	3	3	1552	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What dost thou mean?
Othello	3	3	1553	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Othello	3	3	1554	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Othello	3	3	1555	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;
Othello	3	3	1556	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.
Othello	3	3	1557	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But he that filches from me my good name
Othello	3	3	1558	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Robs me of that which not enriches him
Othello	3	3	1559	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And makes me poor indeed.
Othello	3	3	1560	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.
Othello	3	3	1561	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,
Othello	3	3	1562	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.
Othello	3	3	1563	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Ha?
Othello	3	3	1564	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
Othello	3	3	1565	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
Othello	3	3	1566	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
Othello	3	3	1567	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
Othello	3	3	1568	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er
Othello	3	3	1569	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!
Othello	3	3	1570	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O misery!
Othello	3	3	1571	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
Othello	3	3	1572	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But riches fineless is as poor as winter
Othello	3	3	1573	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Othello	3	3	1574	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend
Othello	3	3	1575	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	From jealousy!
Othello	3	3	1576	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Why, why is this?
Othello	3	3	1577	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,
Othello	3	3	1578	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To follow still the changes of the moon
Othello	3	3	1579	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt
Othello	3	3	1580	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat
Othello	3	3	1581	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	When I shall turn the business of my soul
Othello	3	3	1582	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Othello	3	3	1583	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous
Othello	3	3	1584	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Othello	3	3	1585	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.
Othello	3	3	1586	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
Othello	3	3	1587	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
Othello	3	3	1588	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,
Othello	3	3	1589	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,
Othello	3	3	1590	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
Othello	3	3	1591	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And on the proof, there is no more but this:
Othello	3	3	1592	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Away at once with love or jealousy.
Othello	3	3	1593	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason
Othello	3	3	1594	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To show the love and duty that I bear you
Othello	3	3	1595	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,
Othello	3	3	1596	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Othello	3	3	1597	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Othello	3	3	1598	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.
Othello	3	3	1599	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I would not have your free and noble nature,
Othello	3	3	1600	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.
Othello	3	3	1601	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I know our country disposition well.
Othello	3	3	1602	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In Venice they do let God see the pranks
Othello	3	3	1603	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience
Othello	3	3	1604	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.
Othello	3	3	1605	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Dost thou say so?
Othello	3	3	1606	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She did deceive her father, marrying you,
Othello	3	3	1607	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,
Othello	3	3	1608	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She loved them most.
Othello	3	3	1609	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And so she did.
Othello	3	3	1610	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Why, go to, then!
Othello	3	3	1611	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
Othello	3	3	1612	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,
Othello	3	3	1613	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to blame.
Othello	3	3	1614	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
Othello	3	3	1615	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For too much loving you.
Othello	3	3	1616	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I am bound to thee forever.
Othello	3	3	1617	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.
Othello	3	3	1618	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Not a jot, not a jot.
Othello	3	3	1619	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I’ faith, I fear it has.
Othello	3	3	1620	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I hope you will consider what is spoke
Othello	3	3	1621	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.
Othello	3	3	1622	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I am to pray you not to strain my speech
Othello	3	3	1623	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Othello	3	3	1624	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Than to suspicion.
Othello	3	3	1625	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I will not.
Othello	3	3	1626	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Should you do so, my lord,
Othello	3	3	1627	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My speech should fall into such vile success
Othello	3	3	1628	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend.
Othello	3	3	1629	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My lord, I see you’re moved.
Othello	3	3	1630	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	No, not much moved.
Othello	3	3	1631	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.
Othello	3	3	1632	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Long live she so! And long live you to think so!
Othello	3	3	1633	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And yet, how nature erring from itself—
Othello	3	3	1634	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,
Othello	3	3	1635	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Not to affect many proposèd matches
Othello	3	3	1636	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Othello	3	3	1637	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Whereto we see in all things nature tends—
Othello	3	3	1638	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,
Othello	3	3	1639	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural—
Othello	3	3	1640	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But pardon me—I do not in position
Othello	3	3	1641	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear
Othello	3	3	1642	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
Othello	3	3	1643	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	May fall to match you with her country forms
Othello	3	3	1644	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And happily repent.
Othello	3	3	1645	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Farewell, farewell!
Othello	3	3	1646	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.
Othello	3	3	1647	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.
Othello	3	3	1648	direction	business	Iago_Oth	, beginning to exit
Othello	3	3	1649	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My lord, I take my leave.
Othello	3	3	1650	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Othello	3	3	1651	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
Othello	3	3	1652	direction	business	Iago_Oth	, returning
Othello	3	3	1653	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor
Othello	3	3	1654	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.
Othello	3	3	1655	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place—
Othello	3	3	1656	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For sure he fills it up with great ability—
Othello	3	3	1657	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
Othello	3	3	1658	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You shall by that perceive him and his means.
Othello	3	3	1659	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Note if your lady strain his entertainment
Othello	3	3	1660	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	With any strong or vehement importunity.
Othello	3	3	1661	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,
Othello	3	3	1662	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Let me be thought too busy in my fears—
Othello	3	3	1663	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As worthy cause I have to fear I am—
Othello	3	3	1664	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.
Othello	3	3	1665	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Fear not my government.
Othello	3	3	1666	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I once more take my leave.
Othello	3	3	1667	direction	exit	Iago_Oth	He exits.
Othello	3	3	1668	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,
Othello	3	3	1669	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit
Othello	3	3	1670	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Othello	3	3	1671	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
Othello	3	3	1672	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind
Othello	3	3	1673	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
Othello	3	3	1674	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And have not those soft parts of conversation
Othello	3	3	1675	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That chamberers have, or for I am declined

Othello	3	3	1677	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief
Othello	3	3	1678	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
Othello	3	3	1679	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That we can call these delicate creatures ours
Othello	3	3	1680	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad
Othello	3	3	1681	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And live upon the vapor of a dungeon
Othello	3	3	1682	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Than keep a corner in the thing I love
Othello	3	3	1683	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones;
Othello	3	3	1684	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Prerogatived are they less than the base.
Othello	3	3	1685	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
Othello	3	3	1686	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us

Othello	3	3	1690	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’ll not believe ’t.
Othello	3	3	1691	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	How now, my dear Othello?
Othello	3	3	1692	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Your dinner, and the generous islanders
Othello	3	3	1693	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	By you invited, do attend your presence.
Othello	3	3	1694	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I am to blame.
Othello	3	3	1695	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?
Othello	3	3	1696	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I have a pain upon my forehead, here.
Othello	3	3	1697	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Faith, that’s with watching. ’Twill away again.
Othello	3	3	1698	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Let me but bind it hard; within this hour
Othello	3	3	1699	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It will be well.

Othello	3	3	1709	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Othello	3	3	1710	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Wooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token
Othello	3	3	1711	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	(For he conjured her she should ever keep it)
Othello	3	3	1712	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	That she reserves it evermore about her
Othello	3	3	1713	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out
Othello	3	3	1714	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And give ’t Iago. What he will do with it
Othello	3	3	1715	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Heaven knows, not I.

Othello	3	3	1719	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Do not you chide. I have a thing for you.
Othello	3	3	1720	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You have a thing for me? It is a common thing—
Othello	3	3	1721	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Ha?
Othello	3	3	1722	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To have a foolish wife.
Othello	3	3	1723	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	O, is that all? What will you give me now
Othello	3	3	1724	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	For that same handkerchief?
Othello	3	3	1725	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What handkerchief?
Othello	3	3	1726	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	What handkerchief?
Othello	3	3	1727	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
Othello	3	3	1728	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	That which so often you did bid me steal.
Othello	3	3	1729	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Hast stol’n it from her?
Othello	3	3	1730	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	No, faith, she let it drop by negligence,
Othello	3	3	1731	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And to th’ advantage I, being here, took ’t up.
Othello	3	3	1732	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Look, here ’tis.
Othello	3	3	1733	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	A good wench! Give it me.
Othello	3	3	1734	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	What will you do with ’t, that you have been so earnest

Othello	3	3	1738	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	If it be not for some purpose of import,
Othello	3	3	1739	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad
Othello	3	3	1740	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	When she shall lack it.
Othello	3	3	1741	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Be not acknown on ’t.

Othello	3	3	1744	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin
Othello	3	3	1745	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And let him find it. Trifles light as air
Othello	3	3	1746	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Are to the jealous confirmations strong
Othello	3	3	1747	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.
Othello	3	3	1748	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The Moor already changes with my poison;
Othello	3	3	1749	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
Othello	3	3	1750	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
Othello	3	3	1751	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But with a little act upon the blood

Othello	3	3	1754	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I did say so.
Othello	3	3	1755	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora
Othello	3	3	1756	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
Othello	3	3	1757	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Othello	3	3	1758	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which thou owedst yesterday.
Othello	3	3	1759	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Ha, ha, false to me?
Othello	3	3	1760	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Why, how now, general? No more of that!
Othello	3	3	1761	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
Othello	3	3	1762	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I swear ’tis better to be much abused
Othello	3	3	1763	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Than but to know ’t a little.
Othello	3	3	1764	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	How now, my lord?
Othello	3	3	1765	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?
Othello	3	3	1766	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.
Othello	3	3	1767	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry.
Othello	3	3	1768	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
Othello	3	3	1769	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,
Othello	3	3	1770	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.
Othello	3	3	1771	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I am sorry to hear this.
Othello	3	3	1772	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I had been happy if the general camp,
Othello	3	3	1773	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
Othello	3	3	1774	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	So I had nothing known. O, now, forever
Othello	3	3	1775	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!
Othello	3	3	1776	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars
Othello	3	3	1777	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!
Othello	3	3	1778	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
Othello	3	3	1779	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,
Othello	3	3	1780	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The royal banner, and all quality,
Othello	3	3	1781	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
Othello	3	3	1782	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
Othello	3	3	1783	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,
Othello	3	3	1784	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!
Othello	3	3	1785	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is ’t possible, my lord?
Othello	3	3	1786	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!
Othello	3	3	1787	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,
Othello	3	3	1788	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,
Othello	3	3	1789	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Othello	3	3	1790	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Than answer my waked wrath.
Othello	3	3	1791	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is ’t come to this?
Othello	3	3	1792	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it
Othello	3	3	1793	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
Othello	3	3	1794	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!
Othello	3	3	1795	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My noble lord—
Othello	3	3	1796	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Othello	3	3	1797	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;
Othello	3	3	1798	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	On horror’s head horrors accumulate;
Othello	3	3	1799	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;
Othello	3	3	1800	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Othello	3	3	1801	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Greater than that.
Othello	3	3	1802	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	O grace! O heaven forgive me!
Othello	3	3	1803	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?
Othello	3	3	1804	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,
Othello	3	3	1805	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!—
Othello	3	3	1806	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:
Othello	3	3	1807	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To be direct and honest is not safe.—
Othello	3	3	1808	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I thank you for this profit, and from hence
Othello	3	3	1809	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.
Othello	3	3	1810	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.
Othello	3	3	1811	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool
Othello	3	3	1812	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And loses that it works for.
Othello	3	3	1813	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	By the world,
Othello	3	3	1814	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I think my wife be honest and think she is not.
Othello	3	3	1815	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
Othello	3	3	1816	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh
Othello	3	3	1817	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black
Othello	3	3	1818	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Othello	3	3	1819	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
Othello	3	3	1820	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
Othello	3	3	1821	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I see you are eaten up with passion.
Othello	3	3	1822	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I do repent me that I put it to you.
Othello	3	3	1823	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You would be satisfied?
Othello	3	3	1824	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Would? Nay, and I will.
Othello	3	3	1825	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?
Othello	3	3	1826	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,
Othello	3	3	1827	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Behold her topped?
Othello	3	3	1828	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Death and damnation! O!
Othello	3	3	1829	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
Othello	3	3	1830	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then
Othello	3	3	1831	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
Othello	3	3	1832	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	More than their own! What then? How then?
Othello	3	3	1833	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?
Othello	3	3	1834	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It is impossible you should see this,
Othello	3	3	1835	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
Othello	3	3	1836	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
Othello	3	3	1837	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,
Othello	3	3	1838	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If imputation and strong circumstances
Othello	3	3	1839	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which lead directly to the door of truth
Othello	3	3	1840	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.
Othello	3	3	1841	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.
Othello	3	3	1842	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I do not like the office,
Othello	3	3	1843	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But sith I am entered in this cause so far,
Othello	3	3	1844	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love,
Othello	3	3	1845	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,
Othello	3	3	1846	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And being troubled with a raging tooth
Othello	3	3	1847	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I could not sleep. There are a kind of men
Othello	3	3	1848	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter
Othello	3	3	1849	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.
Othello	3	3	1850	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	In sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona,
Othello	3	3	1851	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.”
Othello	3	3	1852	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Othello	3	3	1853	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cry “O sweet creature!” then kiss me hard,
Othello	3	3	1854	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As if he plucked up kisses by the roots
Othello	3	3	1855	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
Othello	3	3	1856	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	O’er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then
Othello	3	3	1857	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cried “Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!”
Othello	3	3	1858	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O monstrous! Monstrous!
Othello	3	3	1859	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nay, this was but his dream.
Othello	3	3	1860	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
Othello	3	3	1861	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
Othello	3	3	1862	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And this may help to thicken other proofs
Othello	3	3	1863	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That do demonstrate thinly.
Othello	3	3	1864	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I’ll tear her all to pieces.
Othello	3	3	1865	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.
Othello	3	3	1866	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:
Othello	3	3	1867	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Othello	3	3	1868	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?
Othello	3	3	1869	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.
Othello	3	3	1870	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I know not that; but such a handkerchief—
Othello	3	3	1871	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today
Othello	3	3	1872	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	See Cassio wipe his beard with.
Othello	3	3	1873	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	If it be that—
Othello	3	3	1874	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If it be that, or any that was hers,
Othello	3	3	1875	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It speaks against her with the other proofs.
Othello	3	3	1876	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
Othello	3	3	1877	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Othello	3	3	1878	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,
Othello	3	3	1879	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
Othello	3	3	1880	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Tis gone.
Othello	3	3	1881	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!
Othello	3	3	1882	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
Othello	3	3	1883	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
Othello	3	3	1884	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!
Othello	3	3	1885	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Yet be content.
Othello	3	3	1886	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O, blood, blood, blood!
Othello	3	3	1887	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.
Othello	3	3	1888	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
Othello	3	3	1889	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Whose icy current and compulsive course
Othello	3	3	1890	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
Othello	3	3	1891	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Othello	3	3	1892	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace
Othello	3	3	1893	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,
Othello	3	3	1894	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Till that a capable and wide revenge
Othello	3	3	1895	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Swallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,
Othello	3	3	1896	direction	business	Othello_Oth	He kneels.
Othello	3	3	1897	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In the due reverence of a sacred vow,
Othello	3	3	1898	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I here engage my words.
Othello	3	3	1899	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do not rise yet.
Othello	3	3	1900	direction	business	Iago_Oth	Iago kneels.
Othello	3	3	1901	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
Othello	3	3	1902	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You elements that clip us round about,
Othello	3	3	1903	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Witness that here Iago doth give up
Othello	3	3	1904	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The execution of his wit, hands, heart
Othello	3	3	1905	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,
Othello	3	3	1906	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And to obey shall be in me remorse,
Othello	3	3	1907	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What bloody business ever.
Othello	3	3	1908	direction	business	Othello_Oth	They rise.
Othello	3	3	1908	direction	business	Iago_Oth	They rise.
Othello	3	3	1909	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I greet thy love
Othello	3	3	1910	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous,
Othello	3	3	1911	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.
Othello	3	3	1912	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Within these three days let me hear thee say
Othello	3	3	1913	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That Cassio’s not alive.
Othello	3	3	1914	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My friend is dead.
Othello	3	3	1915	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	’Tis done at your request. But let her live.
Othello	3	3	1916	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!
Othello	3	3	1917	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw
Othello	3	3	1918	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To furnish me with some swift means of death
Othello	3	3	1919	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
Othello	3	3	1920	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I am your own forever.
Othello	3	3	1921	direction	exit	Othello_Oth	They exit.
Othello	3	3	1921	direction	exit	Iago_Oth	They exit.
Othello	3	4	1922	direction	entrance	Desdemona_Oth	Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.
Othello	3	4	1922	direction	entrance	Emilia_Oth	Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.

Othello	3	4	1923	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
Othello	3	4	1924	speech	prose	Clown_Oth	I dare not say he lies anywhere.
Othello	3	4	1925	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Why, man?
Othello	3	4	1926	speech	prose	Clown_Oth	He’s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies, ’tis stabbing.
Othello	3	4	1927	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Go to! Where lodges he?
Othello	3	4	1928	speech	prose	Clown_Oth	To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
Othello	3	4	1929	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Can anything be made of this?
Othello	3	4	1930	speech	prose	Clown_Oth	I know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
Othello	3	4	1931	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
Othello	3	4	1932	speech	prose	Clown_Oth	I will catechize the world for him—that is, make questions, and by them answer.
Othello	3	4	1933	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.
Othello	3	4	1934	speech	prose	Clown_Oth	To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
Othello	3	4	1935	direction	exit	Clown_Oth	Clown exits.
Othello	3	4	1936	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
Othello	3	4	1937	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I know not, madam.
Othello	3	4	1938	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Othello	3	4	1939	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor
Othello	3	4	1940	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
Othello	3	4	1941	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	As jealous creatures are, it were enough
Othello	3	4	1942	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To put him to ill thinking.
Othello	3	4	1943	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Is he not jealous?
Othello	3	4	1944	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Othello	3	4	1945	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Drew all such humors from him.
Othello	3	4	1946	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Look where he comes.

Othello	3	4	1948	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I will not leave him now till Cassio
Othello	3	4	1949	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Be called to him.—How is ’t with you, my lord?
Othello	3	4	1950	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Well, my good lady. O, hardness to dissemble!—
Othello	3	4	1951	direction	delivery	Othello_Oth	Aside.
Othello	3	4	1952	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	How do you, Desdemona?
Othello	3	4	1953	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Well, my good lord.
Othello	3	4	1954	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
Othello	3	4	1955	direction	business	Othello_Oth	He takes her hand.
Othello	3	4	1955	direction	business	Desdemona_Oth	He takes her hand.
Othello	3	4	1956	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
Othello	3	4	1957	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.
Othello	3	4	1958	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires
Othello	3	4	1959	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
Othello	3	4	1960	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Much castigation, exercise devout;
Othello	3	4	1961	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	For here’s a young and sweating devil here
Othello	3	4	1962	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,
Othello	3	4	1963	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A frank one.
Othello	3	4	1964	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	You may indeed say so,
Othello	3	4	1965	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.
Othello	3	4	1966	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,
Othello	3	4	1967	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
Othello	3	4	1968	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
Othello	3	4	1969	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What promise, chuck?
Othello	3	4	1970	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
Othello	3	4	1971	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.
Othello	3	4	1972	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Lend me thy handkerchief.
Othello	3	4	1973	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Here, my lord.
Othello	3	4	1974	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That which I gave you.
Othello	3	4	1975	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I have it not about me.
Othello	3	4	1976	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Not?
Othello	3	4	1977	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	No, faith, my lord.
Othello	3	4	1978	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That’s a fault. That handkerchief
Othello	3	4	1979	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Did an Egyptian to my mother give.
Othello	3	4	1980	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She was a charmer, and could almost read
Othello	3	4	1981	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
Othello	3	4	1982	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Othello	3	4	1983	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,
Othello	3	4	1984	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye
Othello	3	4	1985	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Should hold her loathèd, and his spirits should hunt
Othello	3	4	1986	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,
Othello	3	4	1987	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,
Othello	3	4	1988	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To give it her. I did so; and take heed on ’t,
Othello	3	4	1989	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Make it a darling like your precious eye.
Othello	3	4	1990	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition
Othello	3	4	1991	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As nothing else could match.
Othello	3	4	1992	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Is ’t possible?
Othello	3	4	1993	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.
Othello	3	4	1994	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A sybil that had numbered in the world
Othello	3	4	1995	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The sun to course two hundred compasses,
Othello	3	4	1996	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	In her prophetic fury sewed the work.
Othello	3	4	1997	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,
Othello	3	4	1998	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful
Othello	3	4	1999	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Conserved of maidens’ hearts.
Othello	3	4	2000	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I’ faith, is ’t true?
Othello	3	4	2001	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Most veritable. Therefore, look to ’t well.
Othello	3	4	2002	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Then would to God that I had never seen ’t!
Othello	3	4	2003	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Ha? Wherefore?
Othello	3	4	2004	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
Othello	3	4	2005	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o’ th’ way?
Othello	3	4	2006	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Heaven bless us!
Othello	3	4	2007	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Say you?
Othello	3	4	2008	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It is not lost, but what an if it were?
Othello	3	4	2009	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	How?
Othello	3	4	2010	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I say it is not lost.
Othello	3	4	2011	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Fetch ’t. Let me see ’t!
Othello	3	4	2012	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Why, so I can. But I will not now.
Othello	3	4	2013	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Othello	3	4	2014	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
Othello	3	4	2015	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.
Othello	3	4	2016	direction	delivery	Othello_Oth	Aside.
Othello	3	4	2017	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Come, come.
Othello	3	4	2018	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.
Othello	3	4	2019	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The handkerchief!
Othello	3	4	2020	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I pray, talk me of Cassio.
Othello	3	4	2021	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The handkerchief!
Othello	3	4	2022	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	A man that all his time
Othello	3	4	2023	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Hath founded his good fortunes on your love;
Othello	3	4	2024	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Shared dangers with you—
Othello	3	4	2025	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	The handkerchief!
Othello	3	4	2026	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I’ faith, you are to blame.
Othello	3	4	2027	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Zounds!
Othello	3	4	2028	direction	exit	Othello_Oth	Othello exits.
Othello	3	4	2029	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Is not this man jealous?
Othello	3	4	2030	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I ne’er saw this before.
Othello	3	4	2031	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief!
Othello	3	4	2032	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
Othello	3	4	2033	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	’Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
Othello	3	4	2034	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
Othello	3	4	2035	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
Othello	3	4	2036	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	They belch us.

Othello	3	4	2037	direction	entrance	Cassio_Oth	Enter Iago and Cassio.
Othello	3	4	2038	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Look you—Cassio and my husband.
Othello	3	4	2039	direction	delivery	Iago_Oth	, to Cassio
Othello	3	4	2040	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	There is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,
Othello	3	4	2041	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.
Othello	3	4	2042	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?
Othello	3	4	2043	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you
Othello	3	4	2044	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	That by your virtuous means I may again
Othello	3	4	2045	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Exist, and be a member of his love
Othello	3	4	2046	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Whom I with all the office of my heart
Othello	3	4	2047	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Entirely honor. I would not be delayed.
Othello	3	4	2048	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	If my offense be of such mortal kind
Othello	3	4	2049	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	That nor my service past nor present sorrows
Othello	3	4	2050	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Nor purposed merit in futurity
Othello	3	4	2051	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Can ransom me into his love again,
Othello	3	4	2052	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	But to know so must be my benefit.
Othello	3	4	2053	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
Othello	3	4	2054	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	And shut myself up in some other course
Othello	3	4	2055	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	To fortune’s alms.
Othello	3	4	2056	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,
Othello	3	4	2057	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My advocation is not now in tune.
Othello	3	4	2058	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him
Othello	3	4	2059	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Were he in favor as in humor altered.
Othello	3	4	2060	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	So help me every spirit sanctified
Othello	3	4	2061	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	As I have spoken for you all my best,
Othello	3	4	2062	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And stood within the blank of his displeasure
Othello	3	4	2063	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.
Othello	3	4	2064	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	What I can do I will; and more I will
Othello	3	4	2065	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.
Othello	3	4	2066	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Is my lord angry?
Othello	3	4	2067	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	He went hence but now,
Othello	3	4	2068	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And certainly in strange unquietness.
Othello	3	4	2069	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon
Othello	3	4	2070	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	When it hath blown his ranks into the air
Othello	3	4	2071	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And, like the devil, from his very arm
Othello	3	4	2072	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Puffed his own brother—and is he angry?
Othello	3	4	2073	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Something of moment then. I will go meet him.
Othello	3	4	2074	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	There’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry.
Othello	3	4	2075	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I prithee do so.

Othello	3	4	2077	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Something, sure, of state,

Othello	3	4	2081	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,
Othello	3	4	2082	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.
Othello	3	4	2083	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	For let our finger ache, and it endues
Othello	3	4	2084	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Our other healthful members even to a sense

Othello	3	4	2086	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Nor of them look for such observancy
Othello	3	4	2087	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,

Othello	3	4	2095	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
Othello	3	4	2096	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	But jealous souls will not be answered so.
Othello	3	4	2097	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	They are not ever jealous for the cause,
Othello	3	4	2098	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster

Othello	3	4	2111	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	I’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
Othello	3	4	2112	speech	verse	Bianca_Oth	And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
Othello	3	4	2113	speech	verse	Bianca_Oth	What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,

Othello	3	4	2132	speech	verse	Bianca_Oth	Why, whose is it?
Othello	3	4	2133	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	I know not neither. I found it in my chamber.
Othello	3	4	2134	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	I like the work well. Ere it be demanded,

Othello	4	1	2155	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	An unauthorized kiss!
Othello	4	1	2156	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Or to be naked with her friend in bed

Othello	4	1	2158	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?
Othello	4	1	2159	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	It is hypocrisy against the devil!

Othello	4	1	2165	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
Othello	4	1	2166	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.
Othello	4	1	2167	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	She is protectress of her honor, too.

Othello	4	1	2171	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But for the handkerchief—
Othello	4	1	2172	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Othello	4	1	2173	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Thou saidst—O, it comes o’er my memory
Othello	4	1	2174	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	As doth the raven o’er the infectious house,
Othello	4	1	2175	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.
Othello	4	1	2176	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Ay, what of that?
Othello	4	1	2177	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	That’s not so good now.
Othello	4	1	2178	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What
Othello	4	1	2179	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?

Othello	4	1	2188	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What hath he said?
Othello	4	1	2189	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
Othello	4	1	2190	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	What? What?
Othello	4	1	2191	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Lie—
Othello	4	1	2192	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	With her?
Othello	4	1	2193	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	With her—on her—what you will.
Othello	4	1	2194	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Lie with her? Lie on her? We say “lie on her” when they belie her. Lie with her—Zounds, that’s fulsome! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief. To confess and be hanged for his labor. First to be hanged and then to confess—I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips—is ’t possible? Confess—handkerchief—O, devil!
Othello	4	1	2195	direction	business	Othello_Oth	He falls in a trance.
Othello	4	1	2196	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Work on,
Othello	4	1	2197	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
Othello	4	1	2198	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
Othello	4	1	2199	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	All guiltless, meet reproach.—What ho! My lord!

Othello	4	1	2202	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	How now, Cassio?
Othello	4	1	2203	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	What’s the matter?
Othello	4	1	2204	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy.
Othello	4	1	2205	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.
Othello	4	1	2206	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Rub him about the temples.
Othello	4	1	2207	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	No, forbear.
Othello	4	1	2208	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The lethargy must have his quiet course.
Othello	4	1	2209	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by
Othello	4	1	2210	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.
Othello	4	1	2211	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do you withdraw yourself a little while.
Othello	4	1	2212	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	He will recover straight. When he is gone,
Othello	4	1	2213	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I would on great occasion speak with you.
Othello	4	1	2214	direction	exit	Cassio_Oth	Cassio exits.
Othello	4	1	2215	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?
Othello	4	1	2216	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Dost thou mock me?
Othello	4	1	2217	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I mock you not, by heaven!
Othello	4	1	2218	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
Othello	4	1	2219	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.
Othello	4	1	2220	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,
Othello	4	1	2221	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And many a civil monster.
Othello	4	1	2222	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Did he confess it?
Othello	4	1	2223	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Good sir, be a man!
Othello	4	1	2224	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked
Othello	4	1	2225	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	May draw with you. There’s millions now alive
Othello	4	1	2226	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Othello	4	1	2227	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.
Othello	4	1	2228	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,
Othello	4	1	2229	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To lip a wanton in a secure couch
Othello	4	1	2230	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,
Othello	4	1	2231	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
Othello	4	1	2232	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.
Othello	4	1	2233	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Stand you awhile apart.
Othello	4	1	2234	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Othello	4	1	2235	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Whilst you were here, o’erwhelmèd with your grief—
Othello	4	1	2236	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	A passion most unsuiting such a man—
Othello	4	1	2237	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Cassio came hither. I shifted him away
Othello	4	1	2238	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,
Othello	4	1	2239	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Bade him anon return and here speak with me,
Othello	4	1	2240	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,

Othello	4	1	2242	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That dwell in every region of his face.
Othello	4	1	2243	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	For I will make him tell the tale anew—

Othello	4	1	2245	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	He hath and is again to cope your wife.
Othello	4	1	2246	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,
Othello	4	1	2247	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Or I shall say you’re all in all in spleen,
Othello	4	1	2248	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And nothing of a man.
Othello	4	1	2249	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Dost thou hear, Iago,
Othello	4	1	2250	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	I will be found most cunning in my patience,
Othello	4	1	2251	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.
Othello	4	1	2252	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That’s not amiss.
Othello	4	1	2253	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
Othello	4	1	2254	direction	business	Othello_Oth	Othello withdraws.
Othello	4	1	2255	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
Othello	4	1	2256	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	A huswife that by selling her desires
Othello	4	1	2257	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
Othello	4	1	2258	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	That dotes on Cassio—as ’tis the strumpet’s plague
Othello	4	1	2259	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
Othello	4	1	2260	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain

Othello	4	1	2263	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,
Othello	4	1	2264	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Othello	4	1	2265	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors
Othello	4	1	2266	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Quite in the wrong.—How do you, lieutenant?
Othello	4	1	2267	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	The worser that you give me the addition
Othello	4	1	2268	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Whose want even kills me.
Othello	4	1	2269	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.
Othello	4	1	2270	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,

Othello	4	1	2276	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	Alas, poor rogue, I think i’ faith she loves me.
Othello	4	1	2277	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
Othello	4	1	2278	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do you hear, Cassio?
Othello	4	1	2279	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Now he importunes him
Othello	4	1	2280	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.
Othello	4	1	2281	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	She gives it out that you shall marry her.

Othello	4	1	2290	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Have you scored me? Well.
Othello	4	1	2291	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
Othello	4	1	2292	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.
Othello	4	1	2293	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble. By this hand, she falls thus about my neck!
Othello	4	1	2294	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Crying, “O dear Cassio,” as it were; his gesture imports it.
Othello	4	1	2295	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so shakes and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!
Othello	4	1	2296	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.—O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
Othello	4	1	2297	speech	prose	Cassio_Oth	Well, I must leave her company.

Othello	4	1	2301	speech	prose	Bianca_Oth	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber and know not who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse. Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.
Othello	4	1	2302	speech	verse	Cassio_Oth	How now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?

Othello	4	1	2323	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks.

Othello	4	1	2325	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Hang her, I do but say what she is! So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician— O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!

Othello	4	1	2335	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I’ll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.
Othello	4	1	2336	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.
Othello	4	1	2337	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very good.

Othello	4	1	2363	speech	verse	Lodovico_Oth	Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?
Othello	4	1	2364	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	A most unhappy one. I would do much

Othello	4	1	2411	speech	verse	Lodovico_Oth	Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate

Othello	4	1	2414	speech	verse	Lodovico_Oth	The shot of accident nor dart of chance

Othello	4	2	2558	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.
Othello	4	2	2559	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I cannot weep, nor answers have I none
Othello	4	2	2560	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Othello	4	2	2561	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.
Othello	4	2	2562	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And call thy husband hither.

Othello	4	2	2564	direction	exit	Emilia_Oth	She exits.
Othello	4	2	2565	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	’Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
Othello	4	2	2566	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	How have I been behaved that he might stick
Othello	4	2	2567	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	The small’st opinion on my least misuse?

Othello	4	2	2569	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What is your pleasure, madam? How is ’t with you?
Othello	4	2	2570	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Othello	4	2	2571	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
Othello	4	2	2572	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,
Othello	4	2	2573	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I am a child to chiding.
Othello	4	2	2574	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What is the matter, lady?
Othello	4	2	2575	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Othello	4	2	2576	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
Othello	4	2	2577	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	As true hearts cannot bear.
Othello	4	2	2578	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Am I that name, Iago?
Othello	4	2	2579	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	What name, fair lady?
Othello	4	2	2580	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Such as she said my lord did say I was.
Othello	4	2	2581	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	He called her “whore.” A beggar in his drink
Othello	4	2	2582	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
Othello	4	2	2583	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Why did he so?
Othello	4	2	2584	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I do not know. I am sure I am none such.
Othello	4	2	2585	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Do not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!
Othello	4	2	2586	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Othello	4	2	2587	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Her father and her country and her friends,
Othello	4	2	2588	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	To be called “whore”? Would it not make one weep?
Othello	4	2	2589	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It is my wretched fortune.
Othello	4	2	2590	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Beshrew him for ’t! How comes this trick upon him?
Othello	4	2	2591	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Nay, heaven doth know.
Othello	4	2	2592	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I will be hanged if some eternal villain,
Othello	4	2	2593	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Othello	4	2	2594	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Othello	4	2	2595	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.
Othello	4	2	2596	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.
Othello	4	2	2597	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If any such there be, heaven pardon him.
Othello	4	2	2598	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!
Othello	4	2	2599	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Why should he call her “whore”? Who keeps her company?
Othello	4	2	2600	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?
Othello	4	2	2601	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,
Othello	4	2	2602	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
Othello	4	2	2603	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	O heaven, that such companions thou ’dst unfold,
Othello	4	2	2604	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And put in every honest hand a whip
Othello	4	2	2605	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	To lash the rascals naked through the world,
Othello	4	2	2606	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Even from the east to th’ west!
Othello	4	2	2607	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Speak within door.
Othello	4	2	2608	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
Othello	4	2	2609	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	That turned your wit the seamy side without
Othello	4	2	2610	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
Othello	4	2	2611	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	You are a fool. Go to!
Othello	4	2	2612	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Alas, Iago,
Othello	4	2	2613	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	What shall I do to win my lord again?
Othello	4	2	2614	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,
Othello	4	2	2615	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel.
Othello	4	2	2616	direction	business	Desdemona_Oth	She kneels.
Othello	4	2	2617	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,
Othello	4	2	2618	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Othello	4	2	2619	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense
Othello	4	2	2620	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Delighted them in any other form,
Othello	4	2	2621	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
Othello	4	2	2622	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And ever will—though he do shake me off
Othello	4	2	2623	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly,
Othello	4	2	2624	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,
Othello	4	2	2625	direction	business	Desdemona_Oth	She stands.
Othello	4	2	2626	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And his unkindness may defeat my life,
Othello	4	2	2627	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	But never taint my love. I cannot say “whore”—
Othello	4	2	2628	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It does abhor me now I speak the word.
Othello	4	2	2629	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	To do the act that might the addition earn,
Othello	4	2	2630	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.
Othello	4	2	2631	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	I pray you be content. ’Tis but his humor.
Othello	4	2	2632	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The business of the state does him offense,
Othello	4	2	2633	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	And he does chide with you.
Othello	4	2	2634	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If ’twere no other—
Othello	4	2	2635	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	It is but so, I warrant.
Othello	4	2	2636	direction	sound	Iago_Oth	Trumpets sound.
Othello	4	2	2637	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Hark how these instruments summon to supper.
Othello	4	2	2638	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	The messengers of Venice stays the meat.
Othello	4	2	2639	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	Go in and weep not. All things shall be well.
Othello	4	2	2640	direction	exit	Desdemona_Oth	Desdemona and Emilia exit.

Othello	4	2	2641	direction	entrance	Roderigo_Oth	Enter Roderigo.
Othello	4	2	2642	speech	verse	Iago_Oth	How now, Roderigo?
Othello	4	2	2643	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	I do not find
Othello	4	2	2644	speech	verse	Roderigo_Oth	That thou deal’st justly with me.
Othello	4	2	2645	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	What in the contrary?
Othello	4	2	2646	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Every day thou daff’st me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now, keep’st from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
Othello	4	2	2647	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Will you hear me, Roderigo?
Othello	4	2	2648	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Faith, I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.
Othello	4	2	2649	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	You charge me most unjustly.
Othello	4	2	2650	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	With naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath received them, and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
Othello	4	2	2651	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Well, go to! Very well.
Othello	4	2	2652	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	“Very well.” “Go to!” I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well! By this hand, I say ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.
Othello	4	2	2653	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Very well.
Othello	4	2	2654	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I tell you ’tis not very well! I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
Othello	4	2	2655	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	You have said now.
Othello	4	2	2656	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
Othello	4	2	2657	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
Othello	4	2	2658	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	It hath not appeared.
Othello	4	2	2659	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than ever—I mean purpose, courage, and valor—this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
Othello	4	2	2660	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
Othello	4	2	2661	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.
Othello	4	2	2662	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	Is that true? Why, then, Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
Othello	4	2	2663	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident—wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
Othello	4	2	2664	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	How do you mean, removing him?
Othello	4	2	2665	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.
Othello	4	2	2666	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	And that you would have me to do?
Othello	4	2	2667	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!
Othello	4	2	2668	speech	prose	Roderigo_Oth	I will hear further reason for this.
Othello	4	2	2669	speech	prose	Iago_Oth	And you shall be satisfied.
Othello	4	2	2670	direction	exit	Roderigo_Oth	They exit.
Othello	4	2	2670	direction	exit	Iago_Oth	They exit.

Othello	4	3	2672	speech	verse	Lodovico_Oth	I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
Othello	4	3	2673	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	O, pardon me, ’twill do me good to walk.
Othello	4	3	2674	speech	verse	Lodovico_Oth	Madam, good night. I humbly thank your Ladyship.
Othello	4	3	2675	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Your Honor is most welcome.
Othello	4	3	2676	speech	verse	Othello_Oth	Will you walk, sir?—O, Desdemona—
Othello	4	3	2677	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My lord?
Othello	4	3	2678	speech	prose	Othello_Oth	Get you to bed on th’ instant. I will be returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there. Look ’t be done.
Othello	4	3	2679	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	I will, my lord.
Othello	4	3	2680	direction	exit	Othello_Oth	All but Desdemona and Emilia exit.
Othello	4	3	2680	direction	exit	Lodovico_Oth	All but Desdemona and Emilia exit.
Othello	4	3	2680	direction	exit	ATTENDANTS_Oth	All but Desdemona and Emilia exit.
Othello	4	3	2681	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
Othello	4	3	2682	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	He says he will return incontinent,
Othello	4	3	2683	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And hath commanded me to go to bed,
Othello	4	3	2684	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And bade me to dismiss you.
Othello	4	3	2685	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Dismiss me?
Othello	4	3	2686	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,
Othello	4	3	2687	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
Othello	4	3	2688	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	We must not now displease him.
Othello	4	3	2689	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I would you had never seen him.
Othello	4	3	2690	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	So would not I. My love doth so approve him
Othello	4	3	2691	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns—
Othello	4	3	2692	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor in them.
Othello	4	3	2693	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
Othello	4	3	2694	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
Othello	4	3	2695	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me
Othello	4	3	2696	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	In one of those same sheets.
Othello	4	3	2697	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Come, come, you talk!
Othello	4	3	2698	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	My mother had a maid called Barbary.
Othello	4	3	2699	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
Othello	4	3	2700	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And did forsake her. She had a song of willow,
Othello	4	3	2701	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune,
Othello	4	3	2702	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And she died singing it. That song tonight
Othello	4	3	2703	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Will not go from my mind. I have much to do
Othello	4	3	2704	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	But to go hang my head all at one side
Othello	4	3	2705	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.
Othello	4	3	2706	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
Othello	4	3	2707	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	No, unpin me here.
Othello	4	3	2708	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	This Lodovico is a proper man.
Othello	4	3	2709	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	A very handsome man.
Othello	4	3	2710	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	He speaks well.
Othello	4	3	2711	speech	prose	Emilia_Oth	I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
Othello	4	3	2712	direction	delivery	Desdemona_Oth	, singing
Othello	4	3	2713	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
Othello	4	3	2714	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sing all a green willow.
Othello	4	3	2715	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
Othello	4	3	2716	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sing willow, willow, willow.
Othello	4	3	2717	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans,
Othello	4	3	2718	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sing willow, willow, willow;
Othello	4	3	2719	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Her salt tears fell from her, and softened the stones—
Othello	4	3	2720	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Lay by these.
Othello	4	3	2721	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sing willow, willow, willow.
Othello	4	3	2722	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Prithee hie thee! He’ll come anon.
Othello	4	3	2723	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
Othello	4	3	2724	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.
Othello	4	3	2725	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Nay, that’s not next. Hark, who is ’t that knocks?
Othello	4	3	2726	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	It’s the wind.
Othello	4	3	2727	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I called my love false love, but what said he then?
Othello	4	3	2728	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Sing willow, willow, willow.
Othello	4	3	2729	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	If I court more women, you’ll couch with more men.—
Othello	4	3	2730	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	So, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch;
Othello	4	3	2731	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Doth that bode weeping?
Othello	4	3	2732	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	’Tis neither here nor there.
Othello	4	3	2733	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	I have heard it said so. O these men, these men!
Othello	4	3	2734	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia—
Othello	4	3	2735	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	That there be women do abuse their husbands
Othello	4	3	2736	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	In such gross kind?
Othello	4	3	2737	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	There be some such, no question.
Othello	4	3	2738	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
Othello	4	3	2739	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Why, would not you?
Othello	4	3	2740	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	No, by this heavenly light!
Othello	4	3	2741	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.
Othello	4	3	2742	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I might do ’t as well i’ th’ dark.
Othello	4	3	2743	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
Othello	4	3	2744	speech	prose	Emilia_Oth	The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price for a small vice.
Othello	4	3	2745	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
Othello	4	3	2746	speech	prose	Emilia_Oth	In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I had done it. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for the whole world—’Uds pity! Who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.
Othello	4	3	2747	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong for the whole world!
Othello	4	3	2748	speech	prose	Emilia_Oth	Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ th’ world; and, having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
Othello	4	3	2749	speech	prose	Desdemona_Oth	I do not think there is any such woman.
Othello	4	3	2750	speech	prose	Emilia_Oth	Yes, a dozen; and as many to th’ vantage as would store the world they played for.
Othello	4	3	2751	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	But I do think it is their husbands’ faults
Othello	4	3	2752	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,
Othello	4	3	2753	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And pour our treasures into foreign laps;
Othello	4	3	2754	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Othello	4	3	2755	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,
Othello	4	3	2756	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Or scant our former having in despite.
Othello	4	3	2757	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Othello	4	3	2758	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Othello	4	3	2759	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Their wives have sense like them. They see, and smell,
Othello	4	3	2760	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
Othello	4	3	2761	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	As husbands have. What is it that they do
Othello	4	3	2762	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	When they change us for others? Is it sport?
Othello	4	3	2763	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I think it is. And doth affection breed it?
Othello	4	3	2764	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?
Othello	4	3	2765	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	It is so too. And have not we affections,
Othello	4	3	2766	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Othello	4	3	2767	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	Then let them use us well. Else let them know,
Othello	4	3	2768	speech	verse	Emilia_Oth	The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
Othello	4	3	2769	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Good night, good night. God me such uses send,
Othello	4	3	2770	speech	verse	Desdemona_Oth	Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.
Othello	4	3	2771	direction	exit	Desdemona_Oth	They exit.
Othello	4	3	2771	direction	exit	Emilia_Oth	They exit.
Othello	5	1	2772	direction	entrance	Iago_Oth	Enter Iago and Roderigo.
Othello	5	1	2772	direction	entrance	Roderigo_Oth	Enter Iago and Roderigo.
