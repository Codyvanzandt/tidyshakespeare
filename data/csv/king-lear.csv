King Lear	1	1	9	speech	prose	Gloucester_Lr	But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account.

King Lear	1	1	10	speech	prose	Edmund_Lr	No, my lord.
King Lear	1	1	11	speech	prose	Gloucester_Lr	My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend.

King Lear	1	2	367	speech	prose	Edmund_Lr	Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

King Lear	1	2	376	speech	prose	Gloucester_Lr	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide; in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction: there’s son against father. The King falls from bias of nature: there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.—Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall lose thee nothing. Do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! His offense, honesty! ’Tis strange.

An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.

King Lear	1	2	392	speech	prose	Edmund_Lr	Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him, and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.
King Lear	1	2	393	speech	prose	Edgar_Lr	Some villain hath done me wrong.

King Lear	2	2	975	speech	verse	Cornwall_Lr	Why art thou angry?
King Lear	2	2	976	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
King Lear	2	2	977	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,

King Lear	2	2	1020	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	It pleased the King his master very late

King Lear	2	2	1022	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,
King Lear	2	2	1023	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,
King Lear	2	2	1024	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	And put upon him such a deal of man
King Lear	2	2	1025	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	That worthied him, got praises of the King

King Lear	2	2	1051	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	Will check him for ’t. Your purposed low correction

Go you and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.

King Lear	4	1	2063	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	Might I but live to see thee in my touch,

Five fiends have been in Poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.

King Lear	4	3	2294	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	A sovereign shame so elbows him—his own unkindness,
King Lear	4	3	2295	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	That stripped her from his benediction, turned her
King Lear	4	3	2296	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights

King Lear	4	5	2316	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

King Lear	4	5	2318	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	What might import my sister’s letter to him?
King Lear	4	5	2319	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	I know not, lady.
King Lear	4	5	2320	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
King Lear	4	5	2321	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,
King Lear	4	5	2322	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
King Lear	4	5	2323	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
King Lear	4	5	2324	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	In pity of his misery, to dispatch

King Lear	4	5	2329	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	The ways are dangerous.
King Lear	4	5	2330	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	I may not, madam.
King Lear	4	5	2331	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	My lady charged my duty in this business.
King Lear	4	5	2332	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
King Lear	4	5	2333	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
King Lear	4	5	2334	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much—
King Lear	4	5	2335	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Let me unseal the letter.
King Lear	4	5	2336	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	Madam, I had rather—
King Lear	4	5	2337	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	I know your lady does not love her husband;
King Lear	4	5	2338	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	I am sure of that; and at her late being here,
King Lear	4	5	2339	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks
King Lear	4	5	2340	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
King Lear	4	5	2341	speech	verse	Oswald_Lr	I, madam?
King Lear	4	5	2342	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	I speak in understanding. Y’ are; I know ’t.
King Lear	4	5	2343	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	Therefore I do advise you take this note:
King Lear	4	5	2344	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,
King Lear	4	5	2345	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	And more convenient is he for my hand

King Lear	4	5	2347	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	If you do find him, pray you, give him this,
King Lear	4	5	2348	speech	verse	Regan_Lr	And when your mistress hears thus much from you,

King Lear	4	6	2445	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	A poor unfortunate beggar.
King Lear	4	6	2446	speech	verse	Edgar_Lr	As I stood here below, methought his eyes

King Lear	4	6	2449	speech	verse	Edgar_Lr	It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,

King Lear	4	6	2463	speech	verse	Edgar_Lr	O, thou side-piercing sight!
King Lear	4	6	2464	speech	prose	Lear_Lr	Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper. Draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace! This piece of toasted cheese will do ’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! I’ th’ clout, i’ th’ clout! Hewgh! Give the word.

King Lear	4	6	2468	speech	prose	Lear_Lr	Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flattered me like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say “ay” and “no” to everything that I said “ay” and “no” to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to. They are not men o’ their words; they told me I was everything. ’Tis a lie. I am not ague-proof.
King Lear	4	6	2469	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	The trick of that voice I do well remember.

King Lear	4	6	2474	speech	prose	Lear_Lr	Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No. The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets. To ’t, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers. Behold yond simp’ring dame, whose face between her forks presages snow, that minces virtue and does shake the head to hear of pleasure’s name. The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to ’t with a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit; beneath is all the fiend’s. There’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie, fie, pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary; sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.
King Lear	4	6	2475	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	O, let me kiss that hand!
King Lear	4	6	2476	speech	prose	Lear_Lr	Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

King Lear	4	6	2487	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	I see it feelingly.
King Lear	4	6	2488	speech	prose	Lear_Lr	What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
King Lear	4	6	2489	speech	verse	Gloucester_Lr	Ay, sir.

King Lear	4	6	2493	speech	verse	Lear_Lr	Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
King Lear	4	6	2494	speech	verse	Lear_Lr	For which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
King Lear	4	6	2495	speech	verse	Lear_Lr	Through tattered clothes small vices do appear.

King Lear	5	3	3231	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	The same,
King Lear	5	3	3232	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?

King Lear	5	3	3242	speech	verse	Kent_Lr	And desperately are dead.
King Lear	5	3	3243	speech	verse	Lear_Lr	Ay, so I think.
King Lear	5	3	3244	speech	verse	Albany_Lr	He knows not what he says, and vain is it
King Lear	5	3	3245	speech	verse	Albany_Lr	That we present us to him.
