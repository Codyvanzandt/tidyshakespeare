Measure for Measure	1	1	25	speech	verse	Escalus_MM	If any in Vienna be of worth
Measure for Measure	1	1	26	speech	verse	Escalus_MM	To undergo such ample grace and honor,

Measure for Measure	1	1	32	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Angelo,
Measure for Measure	1	1	33	speech	verse	Duke_MM	There is a kind of character in thy life
Measure for Measure	1	1	34	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That to th’ observer doth thy history
Measure for Measure	1	1	35	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Measure for Measure	1	1	36	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Measure for Measure	1	1	37	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Measure for Measure	1	1	38	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Measure for Measure	1	1	39	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Measure for Measure	1	1	40	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike
Measure for Measure	1	1	41	speech	verse	Duke_MM	As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched

Measure for Measure	1	1	43	speech	verse	Duke_MM	The smallest scruple of her excellence
Measure for Measure	1	1	44	speech	verse	Duke_MM	But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Measure for Measure	1	1	45	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Herself the glory of a creditor,

Measure for Measure	1	1	47	speech	verse	Duke_MM	To one that can my part in him advertise.
Measure for Measure	1	1	48	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Hold, therefore, Angelo.

Measure for Measure	1	1	63	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned

Measure for Measure	1	1	76	speech	verse	Duke_MM	As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand.
Measure for Measure	1	1	77	speech	verse	Duke_MM	I’ll privily away. I love the people,

Measure for Measure	1	2	101	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.2_MM	Amen.
Measure for Measure	1	2	102	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Thou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the table.

Measure for Measure	1	2	104	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Ay, that he razed.
Measure for Measure	1	2	105	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	Why, ’twas a commandment to command the Captain and all the rest from their functions! They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace.
Measure for Measure	1	2	106	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.2_MM	I never heard any soldier dislike it.
Measure for Measure	1	2	107	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	I believe thee, for I think thou never wast where grace was said.
Measure for Measure	1	2	108	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.2_MM	No? A dozen times at least.
Measure for Measure	1	2	109	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	What? In meter?
Measure for Measure	1	2	110	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	In any proportion or in any language.
Measure for Measure	1	2	111	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	I think, or in any religion.
Measure for Measure	1	2	112	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.
Measure for Measure	1	2	113	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
Measure for Measure	1	2	114	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	I grant, as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the list.
Measure for Measure	1	2	115	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	And thou the velvet. Thou art good velvet; thou ’rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?
Measure for Measure	1	2	116	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	I think thou dost, and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health, but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.
Measure for Measure	1	2	117	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Measure for Measure	1	2	126	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou art full of error. I am sound.
Measure for Measure	1	2	127	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Nay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound as things that are hollow. Thy bones are hollow. Impiety has made a feast of thee.

Measure for Measure	1	2	134	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his head to be chopped off.
Measure for Measure	1	2	135	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so! Art thou sure of this?
Measure for Measure	1	2	136	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.
Measure for Measure	1	2	137	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Believe me, this may be. He promised to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.
Measure for Measure	1	2	138	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.2_MM	Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.
Measure for Measure	1	2	139	speech	prose	GENTLEMEN.1_MM	But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.

Measure for Measure	1	2	145	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	Yonder man is carried to prison.
Measure for Measure	1	2	146	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	Well, what has he done?
Measure for Measure	1	2	147	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	A woman.
Measure for Measure	1	2	148	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	But what’s his offense?
Measure for Measure	1	2	149	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
Measure for Measure	1	2	150	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	What? Is there a maid with child by him?
Measure for Measure	1	2	151	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	No, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?
Measure for Measure	1	2	152	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	What proclamation, man?
Measure for Measure	1	2	153	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
Measure for Measure	1	2	154	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	And what shall become of those in the city?
Measure for Measure	1	2	155	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	They shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.
Measure for Measure	1	2	156	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?
Measure for Measure	1	2	157	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	To the ground, mistress.
Measure for Measure	1	2	158	speech	prose	Bawd_MM	Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of me?
Measure for Measure	1	2	159	speech	prose	Pompey_MM	Come, fear not you. Good counselors lack no clients. Though you change your place, you need not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still. Courage. There will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.

Measure for Measure	1	2	165	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th’ world?
Measure for Measure	1	2	166	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
Measure for Measure	1	2	167	speech	verse	Provost_MM	I do it not in evil disposition,
Measure for Measure	1	2	168	speech	verse	Provost_MM	But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
Measure for Measure	1	2	169	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Thus can the demigod Authority
Measure for Measure	1	2	170	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Make us pay down for our offense, by weight,
Measure for Measure	1	2	171	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
Measure for Measure	1	2	172	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.
Measure for Measure	1	2	173	direction	entrance	Lucio_MM	Enter Lucio and Second Gentleman.
Measure for Measure	1	2	173	direction	entrance	GENTLEMEN.2_MM	Enter Lucio and Second Gentleman.
Measure for Measure	1	2	174	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?
Measure for Measure	1	2	175	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty.
Measure for Measure	1	2	176	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	As surfeit is the father of much fast,
Measure for Measure	1	2	177	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	So every scope by the immoderate use
Measure for Measure	1	2	178	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Measure for Measure	1	2	179	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Like rats that raven down their proper bane,
Measure for Measure	1	2	180	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	A thirsty evil, and when we drink, we die.
Measure for Measure	1	2	181	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors. And yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the mortality of imprisonment. What’s thy offense, Claudio?
Measure for Measure	1	2	182	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	What but to speak of would offend again.
Measure for Measure	1	2	183	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	What, is ’t murder?
Measure for Measure	1	2	184	speech	prose	Claudio_MM	No.
Measure for Measure	1	2	185	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Lechery?
Measure for Measure	1	2	186	speech	prose	Claudio_MM	Call it so.
Measure for Measure	1	2	187	speech	prose	Provost_MM	Away, sir. You must go.
Measure for Measure	1	2	188	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	One word, good friend.—Lucio, a word with you.
Measure for Measure	1	2	189	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	A hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery so looked after?
Measure for Measure	1	2	190	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
Measure for Measure	1	2	191	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	I got possession of Julietta’s bed.
Measure for Measure	1	2	192	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	You know the lady. She is fast my wife,
Measure for Measure	1	2	193	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Save that we do the denunciation lack
Measure for Measure	1	2	194	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Of outward order. This we came not to
Measure for Measure	1	2	195	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Only for propagation of a dower
Measure for Measure	1	2	196	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
Measure for Measure	1	2	197	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Measure for Measure	1	2	198	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Till time had made them for us. But it chances
Measure for Measure	1	2	199	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
Measure for Measure	1	2	200	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
Measure for Measure	1	2	201	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	With child, perhaps?
Measure for Measure	1	2	202	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Unhappily, even so.
Measure for Measure	1	2	203	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	And the new deputy now for the Duke—
Measure for Measure	1	2	204	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Measure for Measure	1	2	205	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Or whether that the body public be
Measure for Measure	1	2	206	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Measure for Measure	1	2	207	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
Measure for Measure	1	2	208	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Measure for Measure	1	2	209	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Whether the tyranny be in his place
Measure for Measure	1	2	210	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Or in his eminence that fills it up,
Measure for Measure	1	2	211	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	I stagger in—but this new governor
Measure for Measure	1	2	212	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Awakes me all the enrollèd penalties
Measure for Measure	1	2	213	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Which have, like unscoured armor, hung by th’ wall
Measure for Measure	1	2	214	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,
Measure for Measure	1	2	215	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	And none of them been worn; and for a name
Measure for Measure	1	2	216	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Measure for Measure	1	2	217	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Freshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.
Measure for Measure	1	2	218	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	I warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke and appeal to him.
Measure for Measure	1	2	219	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	I have done so, but he’s not to be found.
Measure for Measure	1	2	220	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
Measure for Measure	1	2	221	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	This day my sister should the cloister enter
Measure for Measure	1	2	222	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	And there receive her approbation.
Measure for Measure	1	2	223	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
Measure for Measure	1	2	224	speech	verse	Claudio_MM	Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends

Measure for Measure	1	3	242	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Of burning youth.
Measure for Measure	1	3	243	speech	verse	FriarThomas_MM	May your Grace speak of it?
Measure for Measure	1	3	244	speech	verse	Duke_MM	My holy sir, none better knows than you
Measure for Measure	1	3	245	speech	verse	Duke_MM	How I have ever loved the life removed,
Measure for Measure	1	3	246	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Measure for Measure	1	3	247	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Where youth and cost witless bravery keeps.
Measure for Measure	1	3	248	speech	verse	Duke_MM	I have delivered to Lord Angelo,
Measure for Measure	1	3	249	speech	verse	Duke_MM	A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
Measure for Measure	1	3	250	speech	verse	Duke_MM	My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
Measure for Measure	1	3	251	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And he supposes me traveled to Poland,
Measure for Measure	1	3	252	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For so I have strewed it in the common ear,
Measure for Measure	1	3	253	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
Measure for Measure	1	3	254	speech	verse	Duke_MM	You will demand of me why I do this.
Measure for Measure	1	3	255	speech	verse	FriarThomas_MM	Gladly, my lord.
Measure for Measure	1	3	256	speech	verse	Duke_MM	We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
Measure for Measure	1	3	257	speech	verse	Duke_MM	The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Measure for Measure	1	3	258	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Which for this fourteen years we have let slip,
Measure for Measure	1	3	259	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave
Measure for Measure	1	3	260	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Measure for Measure	1	3	261	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Having bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch
Measure for Measure	1	3	262	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Only to stick it in their children’s sight
Measure for Measure	1	3	263	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For terror, not to use—in time the rod
Measure for Measure	1	3	264	speech	verse	Duke_MM	More mocked than feared—so our decrees,
Measure for Measure	1	3	265	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,
Measure for Measure	1	3	266	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And liberty plucks justice by the nose,
Measure for Measure	1	3	267	speech	verse	Duke_MM	The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Measure for Measure	1	3	268	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Goes all decorum.
Measure for Measure	1	3	269	speech	verse	FriarThomas_MM	It rested in your Grace
Measure for Measure	1	3	270	speech	verse	FriarThomas_MM	To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased,
Measure for Measure	1	3	271	speech	verse	FriarThomas_MM	And it in you more dreadful would have seemed
Measure for Measure	1	3	272	speech	verse	FriarThomas_MM	Than in Lord Angelo.
Measure for Measure	1	3	273	speech	verse	Duke_MM	I do fear, too dreadful.
Measure for Measure	1	3	274	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,
Measure for Measure	1	3	275	speech	verse	Duke_MM	’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
Measure for Measure	1	3	276	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done
Measure for Measure	1	3	277	speech	verse	Duke_MM	When evil deeds have their permissive pass
Measure for Measure	1	3	278	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
Measure for Measure	1	3	279	speech	verse	Duke_MM	I have on Angelo imposed the office,
Measure for Measure	1	3	280	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Who may in th’ ambush of my name strike home,
Measure for Measure	1	3	281	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And yet my nature never in the fight
Measure for Measure	1	3	282	speech	verse	Duke_MM	To do in slander. And to behold his sway
Measure for Measure	1	3	283	speech	verse	Duke_MM	I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,
Measure for Measure	1	3	284	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Visit both prince and people. Therefore I prithee
Measure for Measure	1	3	285	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
Measure for Measure	1	3	286	speech	verse	Duke_MM	How I may formally in person bear
Measure for Measure	1	3	287	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
Measure for Measure	1	3	288	speech	verse	Duke_MM	At our more leisure shall I render you.
Measure for Measure	1	3	289	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise,
Measure for Measure	1	3	290	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses
Measure for Measure	1	3	291	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That his blood flows or that his appetite
Measure for Measure	1	3	292	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,

Measure for Measure	1	4	324	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Woe me, for what?
Measure for Measure	1	4	325	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	For that which, if myself might be his judge,
Measure for Measure	1	4	326	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	He should receive his punishment in thanks:
Measure for Measure	1	4	327	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	He hath got his friend with child.
Measure for Measure	1	4	328	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Sir, make me not your story.
Measure for Measure	1	4	329	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	’Tis true.
Measure for Measure	1	4	330	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	I would not, though ’tis my familiar sin

Measure for Measure	1	4	332	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so.
Measure for Measure	1	4	333	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
Measure for Measure	1	4	334	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
Measure for Measure	1	4	335	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	And to be talked with in sincerity

Measure for Measure	1	4	337	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
Measure for Measure	1	4	338	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:
Measure for Measure	1	4	339	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Your brother and his lover have embraced;
Measure for Measure	1	4	340	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
Measure for Measure	1	4	341	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
Measure for Measure	1	4	342	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Measure for Measure	1	4	343	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
Measure for Measure	1	4	344	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Someone with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
Measure for Measure	1	4	345	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Is she your cousin?

Measure for Measure	1	4	348	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	She it is.
Measure for Measure	1	4	349	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	O, let him marry her!
Measure for Measure	1	4	350	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	This is the point.
Measure for Measure	1	4	351	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;

Measure for Measure	1	4	354	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	By those that know the very nerves of state,
Measure for Measure	1	4	355	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	His givings-out were of an infinite distance
Measure for Measure	1	4	356	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
Measure for Measure	1	4	357	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	And with full line of his authority,
Measure for Measure	1	4	358	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
Measure for Measure	1	4	359	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
Measure for Measure	1	4	360	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
Measure for Measure	1	4	361	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
Measure for Measure	1	4	362	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	With profits of the mind: study and fast.
Measure for Measure	1	4	363	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	He—to give fear to use and liberty,
Measure for Measure	1	4	364	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Which have for long run by the hideous law
Measure for Measure	1	4	365	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	As mice by lions—hath picked out an act
Measure for Measure	1	4	366	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life
Measure for Measure	1	4	367	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,
Measure for Measure	1	4	368	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	And follows close the rigor of the statute
Measure for Measure	1	4	369	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	To make him an example. All hope is gone
Measure for Measure	1	4	370	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
Measure for Measure	1	4	371	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business
Measure for Measure	1	4	372	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	’Twixt you and your poor brother.
Measure for Measure	1	4	373	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Doth he so
Measure for Measure	1	4	374	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Seek his life?
Measure for Measure	1	4	375	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Has censured him already,
Measure for Measure	1	4	376	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	And, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant
Measure for Measure	1	4	377	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	For ’s execution.
Measure for Measure	1	4	378	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Alas, what poor ability’s in me
Measure for Measure	1	4	379	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To do him good?
Measure for Measure	1	4	380	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Assay the power you have.
Measure for Measure	1	4	381	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	My power? Alas, I doubt—
Measure for Measure	1	4	382	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Our doubts are traitors
Measure for Measure	1	4	383	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	And makes us lose the good we oft might win
Measure for Measure	1	4	384	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo
Measure for Measure	1	4	385	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	And let him learn to know, when maidens sue
Measure for Measure	1	4	386	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
Measure for Measure	1	4	387	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	All their petitions are as freely theirs
Measure for Measure	1	4	388	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	As they themselves would owe them.
Measure for Measure	1	4	389	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I’ll see what I can do.
Measure for Measure	1	4	390	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	But speedily!

Measure for Measure	2	2	677	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	No ceremony that to great ones longs,
Measure for Measure	2	2	678	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,
Measure for Measure	2	2	679	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe
Measure for Measure	2	2	680	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Become them with one half so good a grace
Measure for Measure	2	2	681	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	As mercy does.
Measure for Measure	2	2	682	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	If he had been as you, and you as he,
Measure for Measure	2	2	683	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	You would have slipped like him, but he like you
Measure for Measure	2	2	684	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Would not have been so stern.
Measure for Measure	2	2	685	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Pray you begone.
Measure for Measure	2	2	686	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I would to heaven I had your potency,
Measure for Measure	2	2	687	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And you were Isabel. Should it then be thus?
Measure for Measure	2	2	688	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	No. I would tell what ’twere to be a judge
Measure for Measure	2	2	689	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And what a prisoner.
Measure for Measure	2	2	690	direction	delivery	Lucio_MM	, aside to Isabella
Measure for Measure	2	2	691	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Ay, touch him; there’s the vein.
Measure for Measure	2	2	692	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
Measure for Measure	2	2	693	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And you but waste your words.
Measure for Measure	2	2	694	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Alas, alas!
Measure for Measure	2	2	695	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Why all the souls that were were forfeit once,
Measure for Measure	2	2	696	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And He that might the vantage best have took
Measure for Measure	2	2	697	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Found out the remedy. How would you be
Measure for Measure	2	2	698	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	If He which is the top of judgment should
Measure for Measure	2	2	699	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	But judge you as you are? O, think on that,
Measure for Measure	2	2	700	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Measure for Measure	2	2	701	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Like man new-made.
Measure for Measure	2	2	702	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Be you content, fair maid.
Measure for Measure	2	2	703	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	It is the law, not I, condemn your brother.
Measure for Measure	2	2	704	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
Measure for Measure	2	2	705	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	It should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.
Measure for Measure	2	2	706	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Tomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him.
Measure for Measure	2	2	707	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	He’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
Measure for Measure	2	2	708	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	We kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven
Measure for Measure	2	2	709	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	With less respect than we do minister
Measure for Measure	2	2	710	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.
Measure for Measure	2	2	711	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Who is it that hath died for this offense?
Measure for Measure	2	2	712	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	There’s many have committed it.
Measure for Measure	2	2	713	direction	delivery	Lucio_MM	, aside to Isabella
Measure for Measure	2	2	714	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Ay, well said.
Measure for Measure	2	2	715	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
Measure for Measure	2	2	716	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Those many had not dared to do that evil
Measure for Measure	2	2	717	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	If the first that did th’ edict infringe
Measure for Measure	2	2	718	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Had answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake,
Measure for Measure	2	2	719	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
Measure for Measure	2	2	720	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Looks in a glass that shows what future evils—
Measure for Measure	2	2	721	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Either now, or by remissness new-conceived,
Measure for Measure	2	2	722	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And so in progress to be hatched and born—
Measure for Measure	2	2	723	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Are now to have no successive degrees
Measure for Measure	2	2	724	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	But, ere they live, to end.
Measure for Measure	2	2	725	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Yet show some pity.
Measure for Measure	2	2	726	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	I show it most of all when I show justice,
Measure for Measure	2	2	727	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	For then I pity those I do not know,
Measure for Measure	2	2	728	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Which a dismissed offense would after gall,
Measure for Measure	2	2	729	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Measure for Measure	2	2	730	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Measure for Measure	2	2	731	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.
Measure for Measure	2	2	732	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
Measure for Measure	2	2	733	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
Measure for Measure	2	2	734	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To have a giant’s strength, but it is tyrannous
Measure for Measure	2	2	735	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To use it like a giant.
Measure for Measure	2	2	736	direction	delivery	Lucio_MM	, aside to Isabella
Measure for Measure	2	2	737	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	That’s well said.
Measure for Measure	2	2	738	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Could great men thunder
Measure for Measure	2	2	739	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
Measure for Measure	2	2	740	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For every pelting, petty officer
Measure for Measure	2	2	741	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Would use his heaven for thunder,

Measure for Measure	2	2	744	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Splits the unwedgeable and gnarlèd oak,

Measure for Measure	2	2	749	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
Measure for Measure	2	2	750	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	As makes the angels weep, who with our spleens

Measure for Measure	2	2	755	direction	delivery	Provost_MM	, aside

Measure for Measure	2	2	757	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
Measure for Measure	2	2	758	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,

Measure for Measure	2	2	766	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Why do you put these sayings upon me?
Measure for Measure	2	2	767	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Because authority, though it err like others,
Measure for Measure	2	2	768	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself

Measure for Measure	2	4	934	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	That you might know it would much better please me
Measure for Measure	2	4	935	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Than to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.
Measure for Measure	2	4	936	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Even so. Heaven keep your Honor.
Measure for Measure	2	4	937	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Yet may he live a while. And it may be
Measure for Measure	2	4	938	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	As long as you or I. Yet he must die.
Measure for Measure	2	4	939	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Under your sentence?
Measure for Measure	2	4	940	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Yea.
Measure for Measure	2	4	941	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve,
Measure for Measure	2	4	942	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
Measure for Measure	2	4	943	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That his soul sicken not.
Measure for Measure	2	4	944	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
Measure for Measure	2	4	945	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
Measure for Measure	2	4	946	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	A man already made, as to remit
Measure for Measure	2	4	947	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Their saucy sweetness that do coin God’s image
Measure for Measure	2	4	948	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	In stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy
Measure for Measure	2	4	949	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Falsely to take away a life true made
Measure for Measure	2	4	950	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	As to put metal in restrainèd means
Measure for Measure	2	4	951	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	To make a false one.
Measure for Measure	2	4	952	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in Earth.
Measure for Measure	2	4	953	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly:
Measure for Measure	2	4	954	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Which had you rather, that the most just law
Measure for Measure	2	4	955	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Now took your brother’s life, or, to redeem him,
Measure for Measure	2	4	956	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
Measure for Measure	2	4	957	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	As she that he hath stained?
Measure for Measure	2	4	958	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Sir, believe this:
Measure for Measure	2	4	959	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I had rather give my body than my soul.
Measure for Measure	2	4	960	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins
Measure for Measure	2	4	961	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Stand more for number than for accompt.
Measure for Measure	2	4	962	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	How say you?
Measure for Measure	2	4	963	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Nay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak
Measure for Measure	2	4	964	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
Measure for Measure	2	4	965	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Measure for Measure	2	4	966	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.
Measure for Measure	2	4	967	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Might there not be a charity in sin
Measure for Measure	2	4	968	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	To save this brother’s life?
Measure for Measure	2	4	969	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Please you to do ’t,
Measure for Measure	2	4	970	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I’ll take it as a peril to my soul,
Measure for Measure	2	4	971	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	It is no sin at all, but charity.
Measure for Measure	2	4	972	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Pleased you to do ’t, at peril of your soul,
Measure for Measure	2	4	973	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Were equal poise of sin and charity.
Measure for Measure	2	4	974	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That I do beg his life, if it be sin
Measure for Measure	2	4	975	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,
Measure for Measure	2	4	976	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer
Measure for Measure	2	4	977	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To have it added to the faults of mine
Measure for Measure	2	4	978	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And nothing of your answer.
Measure for Measure	2	4	979	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Nay, but hear me.
Measure for Measure	2	4	980	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,
Measure for Measure	2	4	981	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Or seem so, crafty, and that’s not good.
Measure for Measure	2	4	982	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Let me be ignorant and in nothing good,
Measure for Measure	2	4	983	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	But graciously to know I am no better.
Measure for Measure	2	4	984	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
Measure for Measure	2	4	985	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	When it doth tax itself, as these black masks
Measure for Measure	2	4	986	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Measure for Measure	2	4	987	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me.
Measure for Measure	2	4	988	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	To be receivèd plain, I’ll speak more gross:
Measure for Measure	2	4	989	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Your brother is to die.
Measure for Measure	2	4	990	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	So.
Measure for Measure	2	4	991	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And his offense is so, as it appears,
Measure for Measure	2	4	992	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Accountant to the law upon that pain.
Measure for Measure	2	4	993	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	True.
Measure for Measure	2	4	994	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Admit no other way to save his life—
Measure for Measure	2	4	995	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	As I subscribe not that, nor any other—
Measure for Measure	2	4	996	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
Measure for Measure	2	4	997	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Finding yourself desired of such a person
Measure for Measure	2	4	998	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Measure for Measure	2	4	999	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Measure for Measure	2	4	1000	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Of the all-binding law, and that there were
Measure for Measure	2	4	1001	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	No earthly mean to save him but that either
Measure for Measure	2	4	1002	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	You must lay down the treasures of your body
Measure for Measure	2	4	1003	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1004	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	What would you do?
Measure for Measure	2	4	1005	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	As much for my poor brother as myself.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1006	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That is, were I under the terms of death,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1007	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Th’ impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies
Measure for Measure	2	4	1008	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And strip myself to death as to a bed
Measure for Measure	2	4	1009	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield
Measure for Measure	2	4	1010	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	My body up to shame.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1011	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Then must your brother die.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1012	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And ’twere the cheaper way.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1013	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Better it were a brother died at once
Measure for Measure	2	4	1014	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1015	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Should die forever.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1016	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
Measure for Measure	2	4	1017	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	That you have slandered so?
Measure for Measure	2	4	1018	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Measure for Measure	2	4	1019	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Are of two houses. Lawful mercy
Measure for Measure	2	4	1020	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1021	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1022	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And rather proved the sliding of your brother
Measure for Measure	2	4	1023	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	A merriment than a vice.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1024	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	O, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1025	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1026	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I something do excuse the thing I hate
Measure for Measure	2	4	1027	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For his advantage that I dearly love.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1028	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	We are all frail.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1029	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Else let my brother die,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1030	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	If not a fedary but only he
Measure for Measure	2	4	1031	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Owe and succeed thy weakness.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1032	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Nay, women are frail too.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1033	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1034	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1035	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Women—help, heaven—men their creation mar
Measure for Measure	2	4	1036	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1037	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For we are soft as our complexions are,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1038	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And credulous to false prints.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1039	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	I think it well.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1040	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And from this testimony of your own sex,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1041	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Measure for Measure	2	4	1042	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1043	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	I do arrest your words. Be that you are—
Measure for Measure	2	4	1044	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	That is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1045	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	If you be one, as you are well expressed
Measure for Measure	2	4	1046	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	By all external warrants, show it now
Measure for Measure	2	4	1047	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	By putting on the destined livery.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1048	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1049	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Let me entreat you speak the former language.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1050	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Plainly conceive I love you.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1051	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	My brother did love Juliet,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1052	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And you tell me that he shall die for ’t.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1053	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1054	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I know your virtue hath a license in ’t
Measure for Measure	2	4	1055	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Which seems a little fouler than it is
Measure for Measure	2	4	1056	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To pluck on others.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1057	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Believe me, on mine honor,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1058	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	My words express my purpose.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1059	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Ha! Little honor to be much believed,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1060	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And most pernicious purpose. Seeming, seeming!
Measure for Measure	2	4	1061	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for ’t.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1062	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Sign me a present pardon for my brother
Measure for Measure	2	4	1063	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Or with an outstretched throat I’ll tell the world aloud
Measure for Measure	2	4	1064	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	What man thou art.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1065	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Who will believe thee, Isabel?

Measure for Measure	2	4	1069	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	That you shall stifle in your own report
Measure for Measure	2	4	1070	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And smell of calumny. I have begun,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1071	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And now I give my sensual race the rein.

Measure for Measure	2	4	1076	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Or else he must not only die the death,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1077	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	But thy unkindness shall his death draw out

Measure for Measure	2	4	1079	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	Or by the affection that now guides me most,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1080	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,

Measure for Measure	2	4	1083	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,

Measure for Measure	2	4	1085	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue,
Measure for Measure	2	4	1086	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Either of condemnation or approof,

Measure for Measure	2	4	1092	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That, had he twenty heads to tender down
Measure for Measure	2	4	1093	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	On twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them up

Measure for Measure	2	4	1097	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	More than our brother is our chastity.
Measure for Measure	2	4	1098	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,

Measure for Measure	3	1	1110	speech	verse	Duke_MM	If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
Measure for Measure	3	1	1111	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1112	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Servile to all the skyey influences
Measure for Measure	3	1	1113	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That doth this habitation where thou keep’st
Measure for Measure	3	1	1114	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1115	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For him thou labor’st by thy flight to shun,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1116	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1117	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st
Measure for Measure	3	1	1118	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Are nursed by baseness. Thou ’rt by no means valiant,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1119	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Measure for Measure	3	1	1120	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1121	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st
Measure for Measure	3	1	1122	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1123	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For thou exists on many a thousand grains
Measure for Measure	3	1	1124	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1125	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1126	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1127	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
Measure for Measure	3	1	1128	speech	verse	Duke_MM	After the moon. If thou art rich, thou ’rt poor,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1129	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1130	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1131	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1132	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1133	speech	verse	Duke_MM	The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1134	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum
Measure for Measure	3	1	1135	speech	verse	Duke_MM	For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1136	speech	verse	Duke_MM	But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep
Measure for Measure	3	1	1137	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Dreaming on both, for all thy blessèd youth
Measure for Measure	3	1	1138	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Becomes as agèd and doth beg the alms
Measure for Measure	3	1	1139	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Measure for Measure	3	1	1140	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty
Measure for Measure	3	1	1141	speech	verse	Duke_MM	To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this

Measure for Measure	3	1	1195	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	The sense of death is most in apprehension,

Measure for Measure	3	1	1289	speech	prose	Duke_MM	Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practice his judgment with the disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honor in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true. Therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible. Tomorrow you must die. Go to your knees and make ready.

Measure for Measure	3	1	1301	speech	prose	Duke_MM	The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness, but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother?
Measure for Measure	3	1	1302	speech	prose	Isabella_MM	I am now going to resolve him. I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.
Measure for Measure	3	1	1303	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	1	1304	speech	prose	Duke_MM	That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore, fasten your ear on my advisings. To the love I have in doing good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother from the angry law, do no stain to your own gracious person, and much please the absent duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business.
Measure for Measure	3	1	1305	speech	prose	Isabella_MM	Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
Measure for Measure	3	1	1306	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	1	1307	speech	prose	Duke_MM	Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
Measure for Measure	3	1	1308	speech	prose	Isabella_MM	I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
Measure for Measure	3	1	1309	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	1	1310	speech	prose	Duke_MM	She should this Angelo have married, was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed. Between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was wracked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
Measure for Measure	3	1	1311	speech	prose	Isabella_MM	Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
Measure for Measure	3	1	1312	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	1	1313	speech	prose	Duke_MM	Left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonor; in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them but relents not.
Measure for Measure	3	1	1314	speech	prose	Isabella_MM	What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

Measure for Measure	3	1	1316	speech	prose	Duke_MM	It is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonor in doing it.

Measure for Measure	3	1	1318	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	1	1319	speech	prose	Duke_MM	This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection. His unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo, answer his requiring with a plausible obedience, agree with his demands to the point. Only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be long, that the time may have all shadow and silence in it, and the place answer to convenience. This being granted in course, and now follows all: we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother saved, your honor untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?
Measure for Measure	3	1	1320	speech	prose	Isabella_MM	The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

Measure for Measure	3	2	1387	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	What news, friar, of the Duke?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1388	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1389	speech	prose	Duke_MM	I know none. Can you tell me of any?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1390	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think you?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1391	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1392	speech	prose	Duke_MM	I know not where, but wheresoever, I wish him well.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1393	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence. He puts transgression to ’t.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1394	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1395	speech	prose	Duke_MM	He does well in ’t.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1396	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1397	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1398	speech	prose	Duke_MM	It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1399	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1400	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1401	speech	prose	Duke_MM	How should he be made, then?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1402	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is certain that when he makes water, his urine is congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion generative, that’s infallible.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1403	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1404	speech	prose	Duke_MM	You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1405	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport, he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1406	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1407	speech	prose	Duke_MM	I never heard the absent duke much detected for women. He was not inclined that way.

Measure for Measure	3	2	1411	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too, that let me inform you.

Measure for Measure	3	2	1413	speech	prose	Duke_MM	You do him wrong, surely.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1414	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke, and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1415	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1416	speech	prose	Duke_MM	What, I prithee, might be the cause?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1417	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	No, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1418	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1419	speech	prose	Duke_MM	Wise? Why, no question but he was.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1420	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1421	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1422	speech	prose	Duke_MM	Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking. The very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must, upon a warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully. Or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice.

Measure for Measure	3	2	1428	speech	prose	Duke_MM	I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1429	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1430	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar

Measure for Measure	3	2	1434	speech	prose	Duke_MM	O, you hope the Duke will return no more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I can do you little harm; you’ll forswear this again.
Measure for Measure	3	2	1435	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	I’ll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1436	direction	modifier	Duke_MM	, as Friar
Measure for Measure	3	2	1437	speech	prose	Duke_MM	Why should he die, sir?
Measure for Measure	3	2	1438	speech	prose	Lucio_MM	Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would the Duke we talk of were returned again. This ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency. Sparrows must not build in his house eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would never bring them to light Would he were returned. Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar. I prithee pray for me. The Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s now past it, yet—and I say to thee— he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.

Measure for Measure	3	2	1468	speech	prose	Duke_MM	None but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be. All difficulties are but easy when they are known.

Measure for Measure	5	1	2039	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	O worthy duke,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2040	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	You bid me seek redemption of the devil.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2041	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak
Measure for Measure	5	1	2042	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Must either punish me, not being believed,

Measure for Measure	5	1	2049	speech	verse	Angelo_MM	And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2050	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2051	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange?
Measure for Measure	5	1	2052	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That Angelo’s a murderer, is ’t not strange?
Measure for Measure	5	1	2053	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2054	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2055	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Is it not strange, and strange?
Measure for Measure	5	1	2056	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Nay, it is ten times strange.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2057	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	It is not truer he is Angelo
Measure for Measure	5	1	2058	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Than this is all as true as it is strange.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2059	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth
Measure for Measure	5	1	2060	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To th’ end of reck’ning.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2061	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Away with her. Poor soul,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2062	speech	verse	Duke_MM	She speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2063	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
Measure for Measure	5	1	2064	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	There is another comfort than this world,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2065	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That thou neglect me not with that opinion
Measure for Measure	5	1	2066	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That I am touched with madness. Make not impossible
Measure for Measure	5	1	2067	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	That which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible
Measure for Measure	5	1	2068	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2069	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
Measure for Measure	5	1	2070	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	As Angelo. Even so may Angelo,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2071	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	In all his dressings, caracts, titles, forms,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2072	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Be an archvillain. Believe it, royal prince,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2073	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	If he be less, he’s nothing, but he’s more,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2074	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Had I more name for badness.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2075	speech	verse	Duke_MM	By mine honesty,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2076	speech	verse	Duke_MM	If she be mad—as I believe no other—
Measure for Measure	5	1	2077	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2078	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Such a dependency of thing on thing,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2079	speech	verse	Duke_MM	As e’er I heard in madness.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2080	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	O gracious duke,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2081	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
Measure for Measure	5	1	2082	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For inequality, but let your reason serve
Measure for Measure	5	1	2083	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2084	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And hide the false seems true.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2085	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Many that are not mad
Measure for Measure	5	1	2086	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
Measure for Measure	5	1	2087	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I am the sister of one Claudio,

Measure for Measure	5	1	2101	speech	verse	Duke_MM	You were not bid to speak.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2102	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	No, my good lord,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2103	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Nor wished to hold my peace.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2104	speech	verse	Duke_MM	I wish you now, then.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2105	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Pray you take note of it, and when you have
Measure for Measure	5	1	2106	speech	verse	Duke_MM	A business for yourself, pray heaven you then

Measure for Measure	5	1	2108	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	I warrant your Honor.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2109	speech	verse	Duke_MM	The warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to ’t.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2110	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2111	speech	verse	Lucio_MM	Right.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2112	speech	verse	Duke_MM	It may be right, but you are i’ the wrong
Measure for Measure	5	1	2113	speech	verse	Duke_MM	To speak before your time.—Proceed.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2114	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I went
Measure for Measure	5	1	2115	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To this pernicious caitiff deputy—
Measure for Measure	5	1	2116	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That’s somewhat madly spoken.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2117	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Pardon it;
Measure for Measure	5	1	2118	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	The phrase is to the matter.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2119	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Mended again. The matter; proceed.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2120	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	In brief, to set the needless process by:
Measure for Measure	5	1	2121	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	How I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2122	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	How he refelled me, and how I replied—
Measure for Measure	5	1	2123	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For this was of much length—the vile conclusion
Measure for Measure	5	1	2124	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	I now begin with grief and shame to utter.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2125	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
Measure for Measure	5	1	2126	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2127	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Release my brother; and after much debatement,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2128	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	My sisterly remorse confutes mine honor,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2129	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2130	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
Measure for Measure	5	1	2131	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For my poor brother’s head.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2132	speech	verse	Duke_MM	This is most likely!
Measure for Measure	5	1	2133	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	O, that it were as like as it is true!
Measure for Measure	5	1	2134	speech	verse	Duke_MM	By heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what thou speak’st,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2135	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Or else thou art suborned against his honor
Measure for Measure	5	1	2136	speech	verse	Duke_MM	In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Measure for Measure	5	1	2137	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
Measure for Measure	5	1	2138	speech	verse	Duke_MM	That with such vehemency he should pursue
Measure for Measure	5	1	2139	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,
Measure for Measure	5	1	2140	speech	verse	Duke_MM	He would have weighed thy brother by himself
Measure for Measure	5	1	2141	speech	verse	Duke_MM	And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2142	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Measure for Measure	5	1	2143	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Thou cam’st here to complain.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2144	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	And is this all?
Measure for Measure	5	1	2145	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	Then, O you blessèd ministers above,

Measure for Measure	5	1	2173	speech	verse	FriarPeter_MM	Most wrongfully accused your substitute,

Measure for Measure	5	1	2494	speech	verse	Mariana_MM	I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.
Measure for Measure	5	1	2495	speech	verse	Duke_MM	Against all sense you do importune her.

Measure for Measure	5	1	2515	speech	verse	Isabella_MM	For Angelo,

Measure for Measure	5	1	2526	speech	verse	Provost_MM	It was commanded so.
