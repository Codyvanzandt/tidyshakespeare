King John	1	1	36	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Till she had kindled France and all the world
King John	1	1	37	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Upon the right and party of her son?
King John	1	1	38	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	This might have been prevented and made whole
King John	1	1	39	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	With very easy arguments of love,

King John	1	1	47	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	So much my conscience whispers in your ear,

King John	1	1	68	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
King John	1	1	69	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	You came not of one mother then, it seems.
King John	1	1	70	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Most certain of one mother, mighty king—
King John	1	1	71	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That is well known—and, as I think, one father.
King John	1	1	72	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But for the certain knowledge of that truth
King John	1	1	73	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.
King John	1	1	74	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.
King John	1	1	75	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother
King John	1	1	76	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	And wound her honor with this diffidence.
King John	1	1	77	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I, madam? No, I have no reason for it.
King John	1	1	78	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That is my brother’s plea, and none of mine,
King John	1	1	79	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	The which if he can prove, he pops me out
King John	1	1	80	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	At least from fair five hundred pound a year.
King John	1	1	81	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Heaven guard my mother’s honor and my land!
King John	1	1	82	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	A good blunt fellow.—Why, being younger born,
King John	1	1	83	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
King John	1	1	84	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I know not why, except to get the land.
King John	1	1	85	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But once he slandered me with bastardy.
King John	1	1	86	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But whe’er I be as true begot or no,
King John	1	1	87	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That still I lay upon my mother’s head.
King John	1	1	88	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But that I am as well begot, my liege—
King John	1	1	89	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!—
King John	1	1	90	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
King John	1	1	91	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	If old Sir Robert did beget us both
King John	1	1	92	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And were our father, and this son like him,

King John	1	1	94	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

King John	1	1	96	direction	delivery	QueenEleanor_Jn	, aside to King John
King John	1	1	97	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	He hath a trick of Coeur de Lion’s face;
King John	1	1	98	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
King John	1	1	99	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Do you not read some tokens of my son
King John	1	1	100	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	In the large composition of this man?
King John	1	1	101	direction	delivery	KingJohn_Jn	, aside to Queen Eleanor
King John	1	1	102	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Mine eye hath well examinèd his parts

King John	1	1	104	direction	delivery	KingJohn_Jn	To Robert Faulconbridge
King John	1	1	105	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Sirrah, speak.
King John	1	1	106	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?
King John	1	1	107	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
King John	1	1	108	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	With half that face would he have all my land—
King John	1	1	109	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
King John	1	1	110	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
King John	1	1	111	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Your brother did employ my father much—
King John	1	1	112	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land.
King John	1	1	113	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Your tale must be how he employed my mother.
King John	1	1	114	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	And once dispatched him in an embassy
King John	1	1	115	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	To Germany, there with the Emperor
King John	1	1	116	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	To treat of high affairs touching that time.
King John	1	1	117	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Th’ advantage of his absence took the King
King John	1	1	118	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	And in the meantime sojourned at my father’s;
King John	1	1	119	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Where how he did prevail I shame to speak.
King John	1	1	120	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
King John	1	1	121	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Between my father and my mother lay,
King John	1	1	122	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	As I have heard my father speak himself,
King John	1	1	123	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	When this same lusty gentleman was got.
King John	1	1	124	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathed
King John	1	1	125	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	His lands to me, and took it on his death
King John	1	1	126	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	That this my mother’s son was none of his;
King John	1	1	127	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	An if he were, he came into the world
King John	1	1	128	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
King John	1	1	129	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
King John	1	1	130	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	My father’s land, as was my father’s will.
King John	1	1	131	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Sirrah, your brother is legitimate.
King John	1	1	132	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him,
King John	1	1	133	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	An if she did play false, the fault was hers,
King John	1	1	134	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
King John	1	1	135	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
King John	1	1	136	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Who as you say took pains to get this son,
King John	1	1	137	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Had of your father claimed this son for his?
King John	1	1	138	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
King John	1	1	139	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;
King John	1	1	140	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	In sooth he might. Then if he were my brother’s,
King John	1	1	141	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	My brother might not claim him, nor your father,
King John	1	1	142	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:
King John	1	1	143	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;
King John	1	1	144	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.
King John	1	1	145	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	Shall then my father’s will be of no force
King John	1	1	146	speech	verse	RobertFaulconbridge_Jn	To dispossess that child which is not his?
King John	1	1	147	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
King John	1	1	148	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Than was his will to get me, as I think.
King John	1	1	149	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Whether hadst thou rather: be a Faulconbridge
King John	1	1	150	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	And, like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
King John	1	1	151	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Or the reputed son of Coeur de Lion,
King John	1	1	152	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Lord of thy presence, and no land besides?
King John	1	1	153	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Madam, an if my brother had my shape
King John	1	1	154	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And I had his, Sir Robert’s his like him,
King John	1	1	155	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
King John	1	1	156	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	My arms such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin
King John	1	1	157	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,
King John	1	1	158	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Lest men should say “Look where three-farthings goes,”
King John	1	1	159	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
King John	1	1	160	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Would I might never stir from off this place,
King John	1	1	161	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I would give it every foot to have this face.
King John	1	1	162	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I would not be Sir Nob in any case.
King John	1	1	163	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
King John	1	1	164	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?
King John	1	1	165	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	I am a soldier and now bound to France.
King John	1	1	166	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Brother, take you my land. I’ll take my chance.
King John	1	1	167	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
King John	1	1	168	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.—
King John	1	1	169	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.
King John	1	1	170	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
King John	1	1	171	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Our country manners give our betters way.
King John	1	1	172	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	What is thy name?
King John	1	1	173	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
King John	1	1	174	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.

King John	1	1	206	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	An if his name be George, I’ll call him “Peter,”
King John	1	1	207	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	For new-made honor doth forget men’s names;

King John	1	1	224	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
King John	1	1	225	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But this is worshipful society
King John	1	1	226	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And fits the mounting spirit like myself;

King John	1	1	257	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
King John	1	1	258	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Upon Good Friday and ne’er broke his fast.
King John	1	1	259	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Sir Robert could do well—marry, to confess—
King John	1	1	260	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Could he get me. Sir Robert could not do it;
King John	1	1	261	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
King John	1	1	262	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To whom am I beholding for these limbs?

King John	2	1	681	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men
King John	2	1	682	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	In undetermined differences of kings.
King John	2	1	683	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Why stand these royal fronts amazèd thus?
King John	2	1	684	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Cry havoc, kings! Back to the stainèd field,
King John	2	1	685	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	You equal potents, fiery-kindled spirits.
King John	2	1	686	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Then let confusion of one part confirm
King John	2	1	687	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	The other’s peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death!
King John	2	1	688	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
King John	2	1	689	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Speak, citizens, for England. Who’s your king?
King John	2	1	690	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	The King of England, when we know the King.
King John	2	1	691	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
King John	2	1	692	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	In us, that are our own great deputy
King John	2	1	693	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And bear possession of our person here,
King John	2	1	694	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
King John	2	1	695	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	A greater power than we denies all this,
King John	2	1	696	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	And till it be undoubted, we do lock
King John	2	1	697	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Our former scruple in our strong-barred gates,
King John	2	1	698	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Kings of our fear, until our fears resolved
King John	2	1	699	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
King John	2	1	700	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
King John	2	1	701	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And stand securely on their battlements
King John	2	1	702	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	As in a theater, whence they gape and point
King John	2	1	703	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
King John	2	1	704	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Your royal presences, be ruled by me:
King John	2	1	705	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
King John	2	1	706	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend
King John	2	1	707	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.
King John	2	1	708	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	By east and west let France and England mount
King John	2	1	709	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Their battering cannon chargèd to the mouths,
King John	2	1	710	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Till their soul-fearing clamors have brawled down
King John	2	1	711	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city.
King John	2	1	712	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I’d play incessantly upon these jades,
King John	2	1	713	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Even till unfencèd desolation
King John	2	1	714	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
King John	2	1	715	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That done, dissever your united strengths
King John	2	1	716	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And part your mingled colors once again;
King John	2	1	717	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Turn face to face and bloody point to point.
King John	2	1	718	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
King John	2	1	719	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Out of one side her happy minion,
King John	2	1	720	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To whom in favor she shall give the day
King John	2	1	721	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And kiss him with a glorious victory.
King John	2	1	722	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
King John	2	1	723	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Smacks it not something of the policy?
King John	2	1	724	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Now by the sky that hangs above our heads,
King John	2	1	725	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
King John	2	1	726	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And lay this Angiers even with the ground,

King John	2	1	731	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
King John	2	1	732	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	As we will ours, against these saucy walls,
King John	2	1	733	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And when that we have dashed them to the ground,
King John	2	1	734	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Why, then, defy each other and pell-mell
King John	2	1	735	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
King John	2	1	736	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
King John	2	1	737	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	We from the west will send destruction
King John	2	1	738	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Into this city’s bosom.
King John	2	1	739	speech	verse	Austria_Jn	I from the north.
King John	2	1	740	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Our thunder from the south

King John	2	1	744	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Austria and France shoot in each other’s mouth.
King John	2	1	745	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I’ll stir them to it. — Come, away, away!
King John	2	1	746	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Hear us, great kings. Vouchsafe awhile to stay,
King John	2	1	747	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league,

King John	2	1	751	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
King John	2	1	752	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Speak on with favor. We are bent to hear.
King John	2	1	753	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanche,
King John	2	1	754	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Is near to England. Look upon the years
King John	2	1	755	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Of Louis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.
King John	2	1	756	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
King John	2	1	757	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Where should he find it fairer than in Blanche?
King John	2	1	758	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
King John	2	1	759	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Where should he find it purer than in Blanche?
King John	2	1	760	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
King John	2	1	761	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanche?
King John	2	1	762	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
King John	2	1	763	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Is the young Dauphin every way complete.
King John	2	1	764	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	If not complete of, say he is not she,
King John	2	1	765	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	And she again wants nothing, to name want,
King John	2	1	766	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	If want it be not that she is not he.
King John	2	1	767	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	He is the half part of a blessèd man,
King John	2	1	768	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Left to be finishèd by such as she,

King John	2	1	770	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Whose fullness of perfection lies in him.
King John	2	1	771	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	O, two such silver currents when they join
King John	2	1	772	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Do glorify the banks that bound them in,
King John	2	1	773	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	And two such shores to two such streams made one,
King John	2	1	774	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
King John	2	1	775	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	To these two princes, if you marry them.
King John	2	1	776	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	This union shall do more than battery can
King John	2	1	777	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	To our fast-closèd gates, for at this match,
King John	2	1	778	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
King John	2	1	779	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
King John	2	1	780	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	And give you entrance. But without this match,
King John	2	1	781	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	The sea enragèd is not half so deaf,
King John	2	1	782	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
King John	2	1	783	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	More free from motion, no, not Death himself
King John	2	1	784	speech	verse	CITIZENS.0.1_Jn	In mortal fury half so peremptory

King John	2	1	788	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Here’s a stay
King John	2	1	789	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
King John	2	1	790	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Out of his rags! Here’s a large mouth indeed
King John	2	1	791	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;
King John	2	1	792	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
King John	2	1	793	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs.
King John	2	1	794	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
King John	2	1	795	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke, and bounce.
King John	2	1	796	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	He gives the bastinado with his tongue.
King John	2	1	797	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Our ears are cudgeled. Not a word of his
King John	2	1	798	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But buffets better than a fist of France.
King John	2	1	799	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Zounds, I was never so bethumped with words

King John	2	1	808	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	I see a yielding in the looks of France.
King John	2	1	809	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their souls
King John	2	1	810	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Are capable of this ambition,
King John	2	1	811	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath

King John	2	1	824	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Find liable to our crown and dignity,
King John	2	1	825	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
King John	2	1	826	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	In titles, honors, and promotions,
King John	2	1	827	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	As she in beauty, education, blood,

King John	2	1	829	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	What sayst thou, boy? Look in the lady’s face.
King John	2	1	830	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
King John	2	1	831	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	A wonder or a wondrous miracle,
King John	2	1	832	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	The shadow of myself formed in her eye,
King John	2	1	833	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Which, being but the shadow of your son,
King John	2	1	834	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow.
King John	2	1	835	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	I do protest I never loved myself
King John	2	1	836	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Till now infixèd I beheld myself

King John	2	1	842	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And quartered in her heart! He doth espy
King John	2	1	843	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Himself love’s traitor. This is pity now,
King John	2	1	844	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That hanged and drawn and quartered there should be

King John	2	1	851	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	Or if you will, to speak more properly,

King John	2	1	854	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	That all I see in you is worthy love,
King John	2	1	855	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	Than this: that nothing do I see in you,
King John	2	1	856	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
King John	2	1	857	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	That I can find should merit any hate.
King John	2	1	858	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?

King John	2	1	862	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love,
King John	2	1	863	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	For I do love her most unfeignedly.

King John	2	1	878	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
King John	2	1	879	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	I know she is not, for this match made up

King John	2	1	889	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	We will heal up all,

King John	2	1	914	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
King John	2	1	915	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Commodity, the bias of the world—
King John	2	1	916	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	The world, who of itself is peisèd well,
King John	2	1	917	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Made to run even upon even ground,

King John	2	1	924	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France,
King John	2	1	925	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,

King John	2	1	927	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
King John	2	1	928	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And why rail I on this Commodity?
King John	2	1	929	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But for because he hath not wooed me yet.
King John	2	1	930	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
King John	2	1	931	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	When his fair angels would salute my palm,
King John	2	1	932	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	But for my hand, as unattempted yet,

King John	2	1	934	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
King John	2	1	935	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And say there is no sin but to be rich;

King John	3	1	947	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Be well advised; tell o’er thy tale again.
King John	3	1	948	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	It cannot be; thou dost but say ’tis so.
King John	3	1	949	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word

King John	3	1	953	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Thou shalt be punished for thus flighting me,
King John	3	1	954	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	For I am sick and capable of fears,
King John	3	1	955	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears,

King John	3	1	963	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
King John	3	1	964	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
King John	3	1	965	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Like a proud river peering o’er his bounds?
King John	3	1	966	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
King John	3	1	967	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Then speak again—not all thy former tale,
King John	3	1	968	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
King John	3	1	969	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	As true as I believe you think them false
King John	3	1	970	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	That give you cause to prove my saying true.
King John	3	1	971	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
King John	3	1	972	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
King John	3	1	973	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And let belief and life encounter so
King John	3	1	974	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	As doth the fury of two desperate men

King John	3	1	978	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Fellow, be gone. I cannot brook thy sight.
King John	3	1	979	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
King John	3	1	980	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	What other harm have I, good lady, done
King John	3	1	981	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	But spoke the harm that is by others done?
King John	3	1	982	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Which harm within itself so heinous is
King John	3	1	983	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

King John	3	1	989	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Patched with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
King John	3	1	990	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I would not care; I then would be content,
King John	3	1	991	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou
King John	3	1	992	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.
King John	3	1	993	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,

King John	3	1	995	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Of Nature’s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,

King John	3	1	1010	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Thou mayst, thou shalt, I will not go with thee.
King John	3	1	1011	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,

King John	3	1	1086	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
King John	3	1	1087	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	I, Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal
King John	3	1	1088	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
King John	3	1	1089	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Do in his name religiously demand
King John	3	1	1090	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Why thou against the Church, our holy mother,
King John	3	1	1091	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	So willfully dost spurn, and force perforce
King John	3	1	1092	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop
King John	3	1	1093	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Of Canterbury, from that Holy See.
King John	3	1	1094	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	This, in our foresaid Holy Father’s name,
King John	3	1	1095	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
King John	3	1	1096	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	What earthy name to interrogatories
King John	3	1	1097	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
King John	3	1	1098	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
King John	3	1	1099	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous
King John	3	1	1100	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.
King John	3	1	1101	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England
King John	3	1	1102	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
King John	3	1	1103	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
King John	3	1	1104	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	But as we under God are supreme head,
King John	3	1	1105	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	So, under Him, that great supremacy
King John	3	1	1106	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Where we do reign we will alone uphold
King John	3	1	1107	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Without th’ assistance of a mortal hand.
King John	3	1	1108	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart
King John	3	1	1109	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	To him and his usurped authority.
King John	3	1	1110	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
King John	3	1	1111	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Though you and all the kings of Christendom
King John	3	1	1112	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
King John	3	1	1113	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
King John	3	1	1114	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
King John	3	1	1115	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
King John	3	1	1116	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
King John	3	1	1117	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Though you and all the rest, so grossly led,
King John	3	1	1118	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
King John	3	1	1119	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
King John	3	1	1120	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.
King John	3	1	1121	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Then, by the lawful power that I have,
King John	3	1	1122	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate;
King John	3	1	1123	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And blessèd shall he be that doth revolt
King John	3	1	1124	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	From his allegiance to an heretic;
King John	3	1	1125	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And meritorious shall that hand be called,
King John	3	1	1126	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Canonizèd and worshiped as a saint,
King John	3	1	1127	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That takes away by any secret course
King John	3	1	1128	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Thy hateful life.
King John	3	1	1129	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, lawful let it be
King John	3	1	1130	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
King John	3	1	1131	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Good father cardinal, cry thou “Amen”
King John	3	1	1132	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	To my keen curses, for without my wrong
King John	3	1	1133	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
King John	3	1	1134	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	There’s law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
King John	3	1	1135	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And for mine, too. When law can do no right,
King John	3	1	1136	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong.
King John	3	1	1137	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
King John	3	1	1138	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	For he that holds his kingdom holds the law.
King John	3	1	1139	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
King John	3	1	1140	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
King John	3	1	1141	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
King John	3	1	1142	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
King John	3	1	1143	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And raise the power of France upon his head

King John	3	1	1145	speech	verse	QueenEleanor_Jn	Look’st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
King John	3	1	1146	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
King John	3	1	1147	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
King John	3	1	1148	speech	verse	Austria_Jn	King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
King John	3	1	1149	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And hang a calfskin on his recreant limbs.
King John	3	1	1150	speech	verse	Austria_Jn	Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
King John	3	1	1151	speech	verse	Austria_Jn	Because—
King John	3	1	1152	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Your breeches best may carry them.
King John	3	1	1153	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Philip, what sayst thou to the Cardinal?
King John	3	1	1154	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
King John	3	1	1155	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Bethink you, father, for the difference
King John	3	1	1156	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
King John	3	1	1157	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Or the light loss of England for a friend.
King John	3	1	1158	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Forgo the easier.
King John	3	1	1159	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	That’s the curse of Rome.
King John	3	1	1160	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O Louis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
King John	3	1	1161	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	In likeness of a new untrimmèd bride.
King John	3	1	1162	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
King John	3	1	1163	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	But from her need.
King John	3	1	1164	direction	delivery	Constance_Jn	, to King Philip
King John	3	1	1165	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, if thou grant my need,
King John	3	1	1166	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Which only lives but by the death of faith,
King John	3	1	1167	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	That need must needs infer this principle:
King John	3	1	1168	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	That faith would live again by death of need.
King John	3	1	1169	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, then tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
King John	3	1	1170	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down.
King John	3	1	1171	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	The King is moved, and answers not to this.
King John	3	1	1172	direction	delivery	Constance_Jn	, to King Philip
King John	3	1	1173	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, be removed from him, and answer well!
King John	3	1	1174	speech	verse	Austria_Jn	Do so, King Philip. Hang no more in doubt.
King John	3	1	1175	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Hang nothing but a calfskin, most sweet lout.
King John	3	1	1176	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	I am perplexed and know not what to say.
King John	3	1	1177	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
King John	3	1	1178	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
King John	3	1	1179	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Good reverend father, make my person yours,
King John	3	1	1180	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
King John	3	1	1181	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
King John	3	1	1182	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	And the conjunction of our inward souls
King John	3	1	1183	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Married, in league, coupled, and linked together
King John	3	1	1184	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	With all religious strength of sacred vows.
King John	3	1	1185	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	The latest breath that gave the sound of words
King John	3	1	1186	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
King John	3	1	1187	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;
King John	3	1	1188	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	And even before this truce, but new before,
King John	3	1	1189	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	No longer than we well could wash our hands
King John	3	1	1190	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
King John	3	1	1191	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	God knows they were besmeared and overstained
King John	3	1	1192	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	With slaughter’s pencil, where revenge did paint
King John	3	1	1193	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	The fearful difference of incensèd kings.
King John	3	1	1194	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
King John	3	1	1195	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	So newly joined in love, so strong in both,
King John	3	1	1196	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
King John	3	1	1197	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Play fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven?
King John	3	1	1198	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Make such unconstant children of ourselves
King John	3	1	1199	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
King John	3	1	1200	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage bed
King John	3	1	1201	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
King John	3	1	1202	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	And make a riot on the gentle brow
King John	3	1	1203	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Of true sincerity? O holy sir,
King John	3	1	1204	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	My reverend father, let it not be so!
King John	3	1	1205	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
King John	3	1	1206	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest
King John	3	1	1207	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	To do your pleasure and continue friends.
King John	3	1	1208	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	All form is formless, order orderless,
King John	3	1	1209	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Save what is opposite to England’s love.
King John	3	1	1210	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Therefore to arms! Be champion of our Church,
King John	3	1	1211	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Or let the Church, our mother, breathe her curse,
King John	3	1	1212	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	A mother’s curse, on her revolting son.
King John	3	1	1213	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
King John	3	1	1214	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	A chafèd lion by the mortal paw,
King John	3	1	1215	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
King John	3	1	1216	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
King John	3	1	1217	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
King John	3	1	1218	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	So mak’st thou faith an enemy to faith,
King John	3	1	1219	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And like a civil war sett’st oath to oath,
King John	3	1	1220	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
King John	3	1	1221	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	First made to God, first be to God performed,
King John	3	1	1222	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That is, to be the champion of our Church!
King John	3	1	1223	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	What since thou swor’st is sworn against thyself
King John	3	1	1224	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And may not be performèd by thyself,
King John	3	1	1225	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
King John	3	1	1226	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Is not amiss when it is truly done;
King John	3	1	1227	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And being not done where doing tends to ill,
King John	3	1	1228	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The truth is then most done not doing it.
King John	3	1	1229	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The better act of purposes mistook
King John	3	1	1230	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Is to mistake again; though indirect,
King John	3	1	1231	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
King John	3	1	1232	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
King John	3	1	1233	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Within the scorchèd veins of one new-burned.
King John	3	1	1234	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	It is religion that doth make vows kept,
King John	3	1	1235	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	But thou hast sworn against religion
King John	3	1	1236	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	By what thou swear’st against the thing thou swear’st,
King John	3	1	1237	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth
King John	3	1	1238	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Against an oath. The truth thou art unsure
King John	3	1	1239	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	To swear swears only not to be forsworn,
King John	3	1	1240	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Else what a mockery should it be to swear?
King John	3	1	1241	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,
King John	3	1	1242	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.
King John	3	1	1243	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Therefore thy later vows against thy first
King John	3	1	1244	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Is in thyself rebellion to thyself.
King John	3	1	1245	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And better conquest never canst thou make
King John	3	1	1246	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
King John	3	1	1247	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Against these giddy loose suggestions,
King John	3	1	1248	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Upon which better part our prayers come in,
King John	3	1	1249	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
King John	3	1	1250	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The peril of our curses light on thee
King John	3	1	1251	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
King John	3	1	1252	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	But in despair die under their black weight.
King John	3	1	1253	speech	verse	Austria_Jn	Rebellion, flat rebellion!
King John	3	1	1254	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Will ’t not be?
King John	3	1	1255	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Will not a calfskin stop that mouth of thine?

King John	3	1	1257	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	Upon thy wedding day?
King John	3	1	1258	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	Against the blood that thou hast marrièd?
King John	3	1	1259	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?
King John	3	1	1260	speech	verse	Blanche_Jn	Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,

King John	3	3	1375	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	But thou shalt have. And, creep time ne’er so slow,
King John	3	3	1376	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
King John	3	3	1377	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I had a thing to say—but let it go.
King John	3	3	1378	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
King John	3	3	1379	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Attended with the pleasures of the world,
King John	3	3	1380	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Is all too wanton and too full of gauds
King John	3	3	1381	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	To give me audience. If the midnight bell
King John	3	3	1382	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
King John	3	3	1383	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
King John	3	3	1384	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
King John	3	3	1385	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And thou possessèd with a thousand wrongs;
King John	3	3	1386	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
King John	3	3	1387	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Had baked thy blood and made it heavy, thick,
King John	3	3	1388	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
King John	3	3	1389	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men’s eyes
King John	3	3	1390	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
King John	3	3	1391	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	A passion hateful to my purposes;
King John	3	3	1392	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
King John	3	3	1393	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
King John	3	3	1394	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
King John	3	3	1395	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
King John	3	3	1396	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
King John	3	3	1397	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.
King John	3	3	1398	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	But, ah, I will not. Yet I love thee well,
King John	3	3	1399	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And by my troth I think thou lov’st me well.
King John	3	3	1400	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	So well that what you bid me undertake,
King John	3	3	1401	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
King John	3	3	1402	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	By heaven, I would do it.
King John	3	3	1403	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Do not I know thou wouldst?
King John	3	3	1404	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
King John	3	3	1405	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	On yon young boy. I’ll tell thee what, my friend,
King John	3	3	1406	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	He is a very serpent in my way,
King John	3	3	1407	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,
King John	3	3	1408	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?
King John	3	3	1409	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Thou art his keeper.
King John	3	3	1410	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	And I’ll keep him so
King John	3	3	1411	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	That he shall not offend your Majesty.
King John	3	3	1412	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Death.
King John	3	3	1413	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	My lord?
King John	3	3	1414	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	A grave.
King John	3	3	1415	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	He shall not live.
King John	3	3	1416	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Enough.
King John	3	3	1417	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.
King John	3	3	1418	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Well, I’ll not say what I intend for thee.
King John	3	3	1419	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Remember. Madam, fare you well.

King John	3	3	1421	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I’ll send those powers o’er to your Majesty.

King John	3	4	1430	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	A whole armada of convicted sail
King John	3	4	1431	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship.
King John	3	4	1432	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Courage and comfort. All shall yet go well.
King John	3	4	1433	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	What can go well when we have run so ill?
King John	3	4	1434	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?

King John	3	4	1438	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	What he hath won, that hath he fortified.
King John	3	4	1439	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	So hot a speed, with such advice disposed,
King John	3	4	1440	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
King John	3	4	1441	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Doth want example. Who hath read or heard
King John	3	4	1442	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Of any kindred action like to this?
King John	3	4	1443	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Well could I bear that England had this praise,

King John	3	4	1446	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Look who comes here! A grave unto a soul,
King John	3	4	1447	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Holding th’ eternal spirit against her will
King John	3	4	1448	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	In the vile prison of afflicted breath.—
King John	3	4	1449	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	I prithee, lady, go away with me.
King John	3	4	1450	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Lo, now, now see the issue of your peace!
King John	3	4	1451	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Patience, good lady. Comfort, gentle Constance.
King John	3	4	1452	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
King John	3	4	1453	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	But that which ends all counsel, true redress.
King John	3	4	1454	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Death, death, O amiable, lovely death,
King John	3	4	1455	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Thou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness,
King John	3	4	1456	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
King John	3	4	1457	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
King John	3	4	1458	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And I will kiss thy detestable bones
King John	3	4	1459	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,
King John	3	4	1460	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And ring these fingers with thy household worms,
King John	3	4	1461	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,
King John	3	4	1462	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And be a carrion monster like thyself.
King John	3	4	1463	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st,
King John	3	4	1464	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And buss thee as thy wife. Misery’s love,
King John	3	4	1465	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, come to me!
King John	3	4	1466	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	O fair affliction, peace!
King John	3	4	1467	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
King John	3	4	1468	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!
King John	3	4	1469	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Then with a passion would I shake the world
King John	3	4	1470	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
King John	3	4	1471	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,
King John	3	4	1472	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Which scorns a modern invocation.
King John	3	4	1473	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
King John	3	4	1474	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Thou art not holy to belie me so.
King John	3	4	1475	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I am not mad. This hair I tear is mine;
King John	3	4	1476	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	My name is Constance; I was Geoffrey’s wife;
King John	3	4	1477	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost.
King John	3	4	1478	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I am not mad; I would to heaven I were,
King John	3	4	1479	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	For then ’tis like I should forget myself.
King John	3	4	1480	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
King John	3	4	1481	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
King John	3	4	1482	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal.
King John	3	4	1483	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	For, being not mad but sensible of grief,
King John	3	4	1484	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	My reasonable part produces reason
King John	3	4	1485	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	How I may be delivered of these woes,
King John	3	4	1486	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And teaches me to kill or hang myself.
King John	3	4	1487	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	If I were mad, I should forget my son,
King John	3	4	1488	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.
King John	3	4	1489	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I am not mad. Too well, too well I feel
King John	3	4	1490	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	The different plague of each calamity.
King John	3	4	1491	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Bind up those tresses.—O, what love I note
King John	3	4	1492	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	In the fair multitude of those her hairs;
King John	3	4	1493	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Where but by chance a silver drop hath fall’n,
King John	3	4	1494	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
King John	3	4	1495	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
King John	3	4	1496	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
King John	3	4	1497	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Sticking together in calamity.
King John	3	4	1498	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	To England, if you will.
King John	3	4	1499	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	Bind up your hairs.
King John	3	4	1500	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Yes, that I will. And wherefore will I do it?
King John	3	4	1501	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
King John	3	4	1502	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	“O, that these hands could so redeem my son,
King John	3	4	1503	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	As they have given these hairs their liberty!”
King John	3	4	1504	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	But now I envy at their liberty,
King John	3	4	1505	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And will again commit them to their bonds,
King John	3	4	1506	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Because my poor child is a prisoner.
King John	3	4	1507	direction	business	Constance_Jn	She binds up her hair.
King John	3	4	1508	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And father cardinal, I have heard you say
King John	3	4	1509	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.
King John	3	4	1510	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
King John	3	4	1511	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
King John	3	4	1512	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	To him that did but yesterday suspire,
King John	3	4	1513	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	There was not such a gracious creature born.
King John	3	4	1514	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
King John	3	4	1515	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
King John	3	4	1516	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
King John	3	4	1517	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	As dim and meager as an ague’s fit,
King John	3	4	1518	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	And so he’ll die; and, rising so again,
King John	3	4	1519	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
King John	3	4	1520	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I shall not know him. Therefore never, never
King John	3	4	1521	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
King John	3	4	1522	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
King John	3	4	1523	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	He talks to me that never had a son.
King John	3	4	1524	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	You are as fond of grief as of your child.
King John	3	4	1525	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
King John	3	4	1526	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
King John	3	4	1527	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
King John	3	4	1528	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
King John	3	4	1529	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
King John	3	4	1530	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
King John	3	4	1531	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	Fare you well. Had you such a loss as I,
King John	3	4	1532	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I could give better comfort than you do.
King John	3	4	1533	direction	business	Constance_Jn	She unbinds her hair.
King John	3	4	1534	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	I will not keep this form upon my head
King John	3	4	1535	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	When there is such disorder in my wit.
King John	3	4	1536	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	O Lord! My boy, my Arthur, my fair son,
King John	3	4	1537	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	My life, my joy, my food, my all the world,
King John	3	4	1538	speech	verse	Constance_Jn	My widow-comfort and my sorrows’ cure!
King John	3	4	1539	direction	exit	Constance_Jn	She exits.
King John	3	4	1540	speech	verse	KingPhilip_Jn	I fear some outrage, and I’ll follow her.
King John	3	4	1541	direction	exit	KingPhilip_Jn	He exits, with Attendants.
King John	3	4	1541	direction	exit	ATTENDANTS.FRENCH_Jn	He exits, with Attendants.
King John	3	4	1542	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	There’s nothing in this world can make me joy.
King John	3	4	1543	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,
King John	3	4	1544	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
King John	3	4	1545	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet world’s taste,
King John	3	4	1546	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	That it yields naught but shame and bitterness.
King John	3	4	1547	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Before the curing of a strong disease,
King John	3	4	1548	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Even in the instant of repair and health,
King John	3	4	1549	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The fit is strongest. Evils that take leave
King John	3	4	1550	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	On their departure most of all show evil.
King John	3	4	1551	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	What have you lost by losing of this day?
King John	3	4	1552	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
King John	3	4	1553	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	If you had won it, certainly you had.
King John	3	4	1554	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	No, no. When Fortune means to men most good,
King John	3	4	1555	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	She looks upon them with a threat’ning eye.
King John	3	4	1556	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
King John	3	4	1557	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	In this which he accounts so clearly won.
King John	3	4	1558	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
King John	3	4	1559	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
King John	3	4	1560	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
King John	3	4	1561	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit.
King John	3	4	1562	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	For even the breath of what I mean to speak
King John	3	4	1563	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
King John	3	4	1564	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Out of the path which shall directly lead
King John	3	4	1565	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Thy foot to England’s throne. And therefore mark:
King John	3	4	1566	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	John hath seized Arthur, and it cannot be
King John	3	4	1567	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That, whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,
King John	3	4	1568	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The misplaced John should entertain an hour,
King John	3	4	1569	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
King John	3	4	1570	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	A scepter snatched with an unruly hand
King John	3	4	1571	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Must be as boisterously maintained as gained.
King John	3	4	1572	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And he that stands upon a slipp’ry place
King John	3	4	1573	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.
King John	3	4	1574	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall.
King John	3	4	1575	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	So be it, for it cannot be but so.
King John	3	4	1576	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	But what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?
King John	3	4	1577	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	You, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,
King John	3	4	1578	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
King John	3	4	1579	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
King John	3	4	1580	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	How green you are and fresh in this old world!
King John	3	4	1581	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	John lays you plots. The times conspire with you,
King John	3	4	1582	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	For he that steeps his safety in true blood
King John	3	4	1583	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Shall find but bloody safety, and untrue.
King John	3	4	1584	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
King John	3	4	1585	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
King John	3	4	1586	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That none so small advantage shall step forth
King John	3	4	1587	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	To check his reign but they will cherish it.
King John	3	4	1588	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	No natural exhalation in the sky,
King John	3	4	1589	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	No scope of nature, no distempered day,
King John	3	4	1590	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	No common wind, no customèd event,
King John	3	4	1591	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	But they will pluck away his natural cause
King John	3	4	1592	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
King John	3	4	1593	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,
King John	3	4	1594	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
King John	3	4	1595	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Maybe he will not touch young Arthur’s life,
King John	3	4	1596	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
King John	3	4	1597	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
King John	3	4	1598	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	If that young Arthur be not gone already,
King John	3	4	1599	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
King John	3	4	1600	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Of all his people shall revolt from him
King John	3	4	1601	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
King John	3	4	1602	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
King John	3	4	1603	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.
King John	3	4	1604	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;
King John	3	4	1605	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And, O, what better matter breeds for you
King John	3	4	1606	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
King John	3	4	1607	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Is now in England ransacking the Church,
King John	3	4	1608	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Offending charity. If but a dozen French
King John	3	4	1609	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Were there in arms, they would be as a call

King John	4	1	1624	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	And bind the boy which you shall find with me

King John	4	1	1635	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Indeed, I have been merrier.
King John	4	1	1636	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Mercy on me!
King John	4	1	1637	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Methinks nobody should be sad but I.

King John	4	1	1639	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Young gentlemen would be as sad as night
King John	4	1	1640	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
King John	4	1	1641	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
King John	4	1	1642	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	I should be as merry as the day is long.

King John	4	1	1646	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?
King John	4	1	1647	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	No, indeed, is ’t not. And I would to heaven

King John	4	1	1665	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
King John	4	1	1666	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
King John	4	1	1667	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
King John	4	1	1668	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Young boy, I must.
King John	4	1	1669	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And will you?
King John	4	1	1670	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	And I will.
King John	4	1	1671	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
King John	4	1	1672	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	I knit my handkercher about your brows—
King John	4	1	1673	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	The best I had, a princess wrought it me—
King John	4	1	1674	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And I did never ask it you again;
King John	4	1	1675	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And with my hand at midnight held your head,
King John	4	1	1676	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And like the watchful minutes to the hour
King John	4	1	1677	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Still and anon cheered up the heavy time,

King John	4	1	1679	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Or “What good love may I perform for you?”
King John	4	1	1680	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Many a poor man’s son would have lien still
King John	4	1	1681	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you;

King John	4	1	1683	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
King John	4	1	1684	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.
King John	4	1	1685	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
King John	4	1	1686	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes—

King John	4	1	1691	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Ah, none but in this Iron Age would do it.
King John	4	1	1692	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
King John	4	1	1693	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears

King John	4	1	1695	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Even in the matter of mine innocence;
King John	4	1	1696	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Nay, after that, consume away in rust

King John	4	1	1698	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Are you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron?

King John	4	1	1710	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Alas, what need you be so boist’rous-rough?
King John	4	1	1711	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	I will not struggle; I will stand stone-still.
King John	4	1	1712	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	For God’s sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
King John	4	1	1713	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,
King John	4	1	1714	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And I will sit as quiet as a lamb.
King John	4	1	1715	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word

King John	4	1	1727	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Come, boy, prepare yourself.
King John	4	1	1728	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Is there no remedy?
King John	4	1	1729	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	None but to lose your eyes.
King John	4	1	1730	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	O God, that there were but a mote in yours,
King John	4	1	1731	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
King John	4	1	1732	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Any annoyance in that precious sense.
King John	4	1	1733	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,
King John	4	1	1734	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
King John	4	1	1735	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
King John	4	1	1736	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
King John	4	1	1737	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.
King John	4	1	1738	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Let me not hold my tongue. Let me not, Hubert,
King John	4	1	1739	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,

King John	4	1	1746	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	I can heat it, boy.

King John	4	1	1748	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Being create for comfort, to be used
King John	4	1	1749	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	In undeserved extremes. See else yourself.
King John	4	1	1750	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	There is no malice in this burning coal.
King John	4	1	1751	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
King John	4	1	1752	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And strewed repentant ashes on his head.
King John	4	1	1753	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
King John	4	1	1754	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	An if you do, you will but make it blush
King John	4	1	1755	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.
King John	4	1	1756	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,
King John	4	1	1757	speech	verse	Arthur_Jn	And, like a dog that is compelled to fight,

King John	4	1	1764	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.
King John	4	1	1765	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Yet am I sworn, and I did purpose, boy,

King John	4	2	1781	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
King John	4	2	1782	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	This “once again,” but that your Highness pleased,
King John	4	2	1783	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Was once superfluous. You were crowned before,
King John	4	2	1784	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	And that high royalty was ne’er plucked off,
King John	4	2	1785	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	The faiths of men ne’er stainèd with revolt;
King John	4	2	1786	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Fresh expectation troubled not the land
King John	4	2	1787	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	With any longed-for change or better state.
King John	4	2	1788	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp,
King John	4	2	1789	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To guard a title that was rich before,
King John	4	2	1790	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To gild refinèd gold, to paint the lily,
King John	4	2	1791	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To throw a perfume on the violet,

King John	4	2	1793	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
King John	4	2	1794	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
King John	4	2	1795	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
King John	4	2	1796	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	But that your royal pleasure must be done,
King John	4	2	1797	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	This act is as an ancient tale new told,
King John	4	2	1798	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
King John	4	2	1799	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Being urgèd at a time unseasonable.
King John	4	2	1800	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	In this the antique and well-noted face
King John	4	2	1801	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Of plain old form is much disfigurèd,
King John	4	2	1802	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	And like a shifted wind unto a sail,
King John	4	2	1803	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
King John	4	2	1804	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Startles and frights consideration,
King John	4	2	1805	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
King John	4	2	1806	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	For putting on so new a fashioned robe.
King John	4	2	1807	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	When workmen strive to do better than well,
King John	4	2	1808	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	They do confound their skill in covetousness,
King John	4	2	1809	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	And oftentimes excusing of a fault
King John	4	2	1810	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Doth make the fault the worse by th’ excuse,
King John	4	2	1811	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	As patches set upon a little breach
King John	4	2	1812	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Discredit more in hiding of the fault
King John	4	2	1813	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Than did the fault before it was so patched.
King John	4	2	1814	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To this effect, before you were new-crowned,
King John	4	2	1815	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	We breathed our counsel; but it pleased your Highness
King John	4	2	1816	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,
King John	4	2	1817	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Since all and every part of what we would
King John	4	2	1818	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.
King John	4	2	1819	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Some reasons of this double coronation
King John	4	2	1820	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I have possessed you with, and think them strong;
King John	4	2	1821	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,
King John	4	2	1822	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I shall endue you with. Meantime, but ask
King John	4	2	1823	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	What you would have reformed that is not well,
King John	4	2	1824	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And well shall you perceive how willingly
King John	4	2	1825	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I will both hear and grant you your requests.
King John	4	2	1826	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Then I, as one that am the tongue of these
King John	4	2	1827	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
King John	4	2	1828	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Both for myself and them, but chief of all
King John	4	2	1829	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Your safety, for the which myself and them
King John	4	2	1830	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Bend their best studies, heartily request
King John	4	2	1831	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Th’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint
King John	4	2	1832	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
King John	4	2	1833	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	To break into this dangerous argument:
King John	4	2	1834	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	If what in rest you have in right you hold,
King John	4	2	1835	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
King John	4	2	1836	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
King John	4	2	1837	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
King John	4	2	1838	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
King John	4	2	1839	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	The rich advantage of good exercise.
King John	4	2	1840	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	That the time’s enemies may not have this

King John	4	2	1857	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	What we so feared he had a charge to do.

King John	4	2	1859	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Between his purpose and his conscience,
King John	4	2	1860	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set.
King John	4	2	1861	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	His passion is so ripe it needs must break.

King John	4	2	1869	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Indeed, we feared his sickness was past cure.
King John	4	2	1870	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Indeed, we heard how near his death he was
King John	4	2	1871	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Before the child himself felt he was sick.
King John	4	2	1872	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	This must be answered either here or hence.

King John	4	2	1875	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
King John	4	2	1876	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	It is apparent foul play, and ’tis shame

King John	5	2	2359	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince,
King John	5	2	2360	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	I am not glad that such a sore of time
King John	5	2	2361	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Should seek a plaster by contemned revolt
King John	5	2	2362	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
King John	5	2	2363	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	By making many. O, it grieves my soul
King John	5	2	2364	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	That I must draw this metal from my side
King John	5	2	2365	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	To be a widow-maker! O, and there

King John	5	2	2370	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	We cannot deal but with the very hand
King John	5	2	2371	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Of stern injustice and confusèd wrong.
King John	5	2	2372	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	And is ’t not pity, O my grievèd friends,
King John	5	2	2373	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	That we, the sons and children of this isle,
King John	5	2	2374	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Was born to see so sad an hour as this,
King John	5	2	2375	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Wherein we step after a stranger, march
King John	5	2	2376	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up

King John	5	2	2392	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	O, what a noble combat hast thou fought

King John	5	2	2394	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Let me wipe off this honorable dew
King John	5	2	2395	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.
King John	5	2	2396	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears,
King John	5	2	2397	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Being an ordinary inundation,
King John	5	2	2398	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	But this effusion of such manly drops,
King John	5	2	2399	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
King John	5	2	2400	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed

King John	5	2	2403	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Lift up thy brow, renownèd Salisbury,
King John	5	2	2404	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And with a great heart heave away this storm.
King John	5	2	2405	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Commend these waters to those baby eyes
King John	5	2	2406	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	That never saw the giant world enraged,
King John	5	2	2407	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Nor met with fortune other than at feasts
King John	5	2	2408	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
King John	5	2	2409	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
King John	5	2	2410	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Into the purse of rich prosperity
King John	5	2	2411	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	As Louis himself.—So, nobles, shall you all,
King John	5	2	2412	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.

King John	5	2	2415	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Look where the holy legate comes apace
King John	5	2	2416	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	To give us warrant from the hand of God,
King John	5	2	2417	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And on our actions set the name of right
King John	5	2	2418	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	With holy breath.
King John	5	2	2419	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Hail, noble prince of France.
King John	5	2	2420	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The next is this: King John hath reconciled
King John	5	2	2421	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in
King John	5	2	2422	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That so stood out against the holy Church,
King John	5	2	2423	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The great metropolis and See of Rome.
King John	5	2	2424	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	Therefore thy threat’ning colors now wind up,
King John	5	2	2425	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And tame the savage spirit of wild war
King John	5	2	2426	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	That, like a lion fostered up at hand,
King John	5	2	2427	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	It may lie gently at the foot of peace
King John	5	2	2428	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And be no further harmful than in show.
King John	5	2	2429	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Your Grace shall pardon me; I will not back.
King John	5	2	2430	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	I am too high-born to be propertied,
King John	5	2	2431	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	To be a secondary at control,
King John	5	2	2432	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Or useful servingman and instrument
King John	5	2	2433	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	To any sovereign state throughout the world.
King John	5	2	2434	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
King John	5	2	2435	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Between this chastised kingdom and myself
King John	5	2	2436	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
King John	5	2	2437	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out
King John	5	2	2438	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
King John	5	2	2439	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	You taught me how to know the face of right,
King John	5	2	2440	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Acquainted me with interest to this land,
King John	5	2	2441	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart.
King John	5	2	2442	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And come you now to tell me John hath made
King John	5	2	2443	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
King John	5	2	2444	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	I, by the honor of my marriage bed,
King John	5	2	2445	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	After young Arthur claim this land for mine.
King John	5	2	2446	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And now it is half conquered, must I back
King John	5	2	2447	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
King John	5	2	2448	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne?
King John	5	2	2449	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	What men provided? What munition sent
King John	5	2	2450	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	To underprop this action? Is ’t not I
King John	5	2	2451	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	That undergo this charge? Who else but I,
King John	5	2	2452	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And such as to my claim are liable,
King John	5	2	2453	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
King John	5	2	2454	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Have I not heard these islanders shout out
King John	5	2	2455	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	“Vive le Roi” as I have banked their towns?
King John	5	2	2456	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Have I not here the best cards for the game
King John	5	2	2457	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	To win this easy match played for a crown?
King John	5	2	2458	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	And shall I now give o’er the yielded set?
King John	5	2	2459	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
King John	5	2	2460	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	You look but on the outside of this work.
King John	5	2	2461	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Outside or inside, I will not return
King John	5	2	2462	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Till my attempt so much be glorified
King John	5	2	2463	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	As to my ample hope was promisèd
King John	5	2	2464	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Before I drew this gallant head of war

King John	5	2	2473	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	My holy lord of Milan, from the King.
King John	5	2	2474	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	I come to learn how you have dealt for him,
King John	5	2	2475	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And, as you answer, I do know the scope
King John	5	2	2476	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And warrant limited unto my tongue.
King John	5	2	2477	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	The Dauphin is too willful-opposite
King John	5	2	2478	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	And will not temporize with my entreaties.
King John	5	2	2479	speech	verse	Pandulph_Jn	He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.
King John	5	2	2480	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
King John	5	2	2481	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	The youth says well! Now hear our English king,
King John	5	2	2482	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	For thus his royalty doth speak in me:
King John	5	2	2483	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	He is prepared—and reason too he should.
King John	5	2	2484	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	This apish and unmannerly approach,
King John	5	2	2485	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	This harnessed masque and unadvisèd revel,
King John	5	2	2486	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	This unheard sauciness and boyish troops,
King John	5	2	2487	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	The King doth smile at, and is well prepared
King John	5	2	2488	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
King John	5	2	2489	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	From out the circle of his territories.
King John	5	2	2490	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
King John	5	2	2491	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
King John	5	2	2492	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To dive like buckets in concealèd wells,
King John	5	2	2493	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
King John	5	2	2494	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks,
King John	5	2	2495	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
King John	5	2	2496	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
King John	5	2	2497	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Even at the crying of your nation’s crow,
King John	5	2	2498	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Thinking this voice an armèd Englishman—
King John	5	2	2499	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
King John	5	2	2500	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
King John	5	2	2501	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms,
King John	5	2	2502	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	And like an eagle o’er his aerie towers
King John	5	2	2503	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.—

King John	5	2	2520	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	Plead for our interest and our being here.
King John	5	2	2521	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Indeed, your drums being beaten will cry out,

King John	5	4	2561	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
King John	5	4	2562	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
King John	5	4	2563	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.

King John	5	4	2568	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	It is the Count Melun.
King John	5	4	2569	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Wounded to death.
King John	5	4	2570	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Fly, noble English; you are bought and sold.
King John	5	4	2571	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
King John	5	4	2572	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	And welcome home again discarded faith.
King John	5	4	2573	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Seek out King John and fall before his feet,
King John	5	4	2574	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	For if the French be lords of this loud day,
King John	5	4	2575	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	He means to recompense the pains you take
King John	5	4	2576	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,

King John	5	4	2578	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,
King John	5	4	2579	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Even on that altar where we swore to you
King John	5	4	2580	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Dear amity and everlasting love.
King John	5	4	2581	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	May this be possible? May this be true?
King John	5	4	2582	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Have I not hideous death within my view,

King John	5	4	2586	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	What in the world should make me now deceive,
King John	5	4	2587	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
King John	5	4	2588	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Why should I then be false, since it is true
King John	5	4	2589	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	That I must die here and live hence by truth?
King John	5	4	2590	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	I say again, if Louis do win the day,
King John	5	4	2591	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	He is forsworn if e’er those eyes of yours
King John	5	4	2592	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Behold another daybreak in the East.
King John	5	4	2593	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	But even this night, whose black contagious breath
King John	5	4	2594	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Already smokes about the burning crest
King John	5	4	2595	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
King John	5	4	2596	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Even this ill night your breathing shall expire,
King John	5	4	2597	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Paying the fine of rated treachery
King John	5	4	2598	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
King John	5	4	2599	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	If Louis by your assistance win the day.
King John	5	4	2600	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Commend me to one Hubert with your king;
King John	5	4	2601	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	The love of him, and this respect besides,
King John	5	4	2602	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
King John	5	4	2603	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
King John	5	4	2604	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	In lieu whereof, I pray you bear me hence
King John	5	4	2605	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	From forth the noise and rumor of the field,
King John	5	4	2606	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
King John	5	4	2607	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	In peace, and part this body and my soul
King John	5	4	2608	speech	verse	Melun_Jn	With contemplation and devout desires.
King John	5	4	2609	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul
King John	5	4	2610	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	But I do love the favor and the form
King John	5	4	2611	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Of this most fair occasion, by the which
King John	5	4	2612	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	We will untread the steps of damnèd flight,
King John	5	4	2613	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	And like a bated and retirèd flood,

King John	5	4	2617	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
King John	5	4	2618	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
King John	5	4	2619	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	For I do see the cruel pangs of death
King John	5	4	2620	speech	verse	Salisbury_Jn	Right in thine eye.—Away, my friends! New flight,

King John	5	5	2626	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	When English measured backward their own ground
King John	5	5	2627	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
King John	5	5	2628	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	When with a volley of our needless shot,
King John	5	5	2629	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	After such bloody toil, we bid good night

King John	5	5	2640	speech	verse	Dauphin_Jn	I did not think to be so sad tonight

King John	5	6	2664	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Unkind remembrance! Thou and endless night
King John	5	6	2665	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me

King John	5	6	2671	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Brief, then; and what’s the news?
King John	5	6	2672	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	O my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,

King John	5	6	2676	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	The King, I fear, is poisoned by a monk.

King John	5	6	2681	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	How did he take it? Who did taste to him?
King John	5	6	2682	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	A monk, I tell you, a resolvèd villain,
King John	5	6	2683	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King
King John	5	6	2684	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
King John	5	6	2685	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
King John	5	6	2686	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
King John	5	6	2687	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	And brought Prince Henry in their company,
King John	5	6	2688	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	At whose request the King hath pardoned them,
King John	5	6	2689	speech	verse	Hubert_Jn	And they are all about his Majesty.
King John	5	6	2690	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Withhold thine indignation, mighty God,

King John	5	7	2708	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	It would allay the burning quality

King John	5	7	2713	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	He is more patient
King John	5	7	2714	speech	verse	Pembroke_Jn	Than when you left him. Even now he sung.
King John	5	7	2715	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
King John	5	7	2716	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	In their continuance will not feel themselves.
King John	5	7	2717	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	Death, having preyed upon the outward parts,
King John	5	7	2718	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
King John	5	7	2719	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
King John	5	7	2720	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	With many legions of strange fantasies,
King John	5	7	2721	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	Which in their throng and press to that last hold
King John	5	7	2722	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that Death should sing.
King John	5	7	2723	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
King John	5	7	2724	speech	verse	PrinceHenry_Jn	Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,

King John	5	7	2739	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Poisoned—ill fare—dead, forsook, cast off,

King John	5	7	2746	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	I beg cold comfort, and you are so strait

King John	5	7	2760	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Are turnèd to one thread, one little hair.
King John	5	7	2761	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
King John	5	7	2762	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	Which holds but till thy news be utterèd,
King John	5	7	2763	speech	verse	KingJohn_Jn	And then all this thou seest is but a clod

King John	5	7	2777	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
King John	5	7	2778	speech	verse	Bastard_Jn	To do the office for thee of revenge,
