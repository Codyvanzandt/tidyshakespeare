Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	2	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	3	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	4	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Were ’t not affection chains thy tender days
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	5	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To the sweet glances of thy honored love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	6	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	I rather would entreat thy company
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	7	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To see the wonders of the world abroad
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	8	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	9	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	10	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	But since thou lov’st, love still and thrive therein,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	11	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Even as I would when I to love begin.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	12	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	13	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	14	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	15	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Wish me partaker in thy happiness
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	16	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	17	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	If ever danger do environ thee,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	18	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	19	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	20	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And on a love-book pray for my success?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	21	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	22	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	That’s on some shallow story of deep love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	23	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	How young Leander crossed the Hellespont.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	24	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That’s a deep story of a deeper love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	25	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For he was more than over shoes in love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	26	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	’Tis true, for you are over boots in love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	27	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And yet you never swam the Hellespont.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	28	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	29	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	30	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	What?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	31	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	32	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment’s mirth
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	33	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	34	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	35	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	If lost, why then a grievous labor won;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	36	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	How ever, but a folly bought with wit,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	37	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Or else a wit by folly vanquishèd.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	38	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	39	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	So, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	40	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	’Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	41	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Love is your master, for he masters you;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	42	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And he that is so yokèd by a fool
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	43	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	44	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	45	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	46	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	47	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And writers say: as the most forward bud
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	48	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	49	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Even so by love the young and tender wit
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	50	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	51	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Losing his verdure, even in the prime,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	52	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And all the fair effects of future hopes.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	53	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	54	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	That art a votary to fond desire?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	55	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Once more adieu. My father at the road
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	56	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Expects my coming, there to see me shipped.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	57	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	58	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Sweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	59	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	60	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Of thy success in love, and what news else
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	61	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Betideth here in absence of thy friend.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	62	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And I likewise will visit thee with mine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	63	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	64	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	As much to you at home. And so farewell.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	65	direction	exit	Valentine_TGV	He exits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	66	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	He after honor hunts, I after love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	67	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	68	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	69	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	70	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	71	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	72	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	73	direction	entrance	Speed_TGV	Enter Speed.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	74	speech	verse	Speed_TGV	Sir Proteus, ’save you. Saw you my master?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	75	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	76	speech	verse	Speed_TGV	Twenty to one, then, he is shipped already,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	77	speech	verse	Speed_TGV	And I have played the sheep in losing him.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	78	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	79	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	An if the shepherd be awhile away.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	80	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then, and I a sheep?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	81	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	I do.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	82	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Why, then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	83	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	84	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	This proves me still a sheep.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	85	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	True, and thy master a shepherd.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	86	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	87	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	88	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	89	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for wages followest thy master; thy master for wages follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	90	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Such another proof will make me cry “baa.”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	91	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	But dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to Julia?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	92	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Ay, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labor.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	93	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Here’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	94	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	95	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Nay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	96	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	97	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	You mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	98	speech	verse	Speed_TGV	From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	99	speech	verse	Speed_TGV	’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	100	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	But what said she?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	101	direction	business	Speed_TGV	, nodding
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	102	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Ay.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	103	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Nod—“Ay.” Why, that’s “noddy.”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	104	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	You mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask me if she did nod, and I say “ay.”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	105	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	And that set together is “noddy.”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	106	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	107	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	108	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	109	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	110	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word “noddy” for my pains.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	111	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	112	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	113	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Come, come, open the matter in brief. What said she?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	114	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	115	direction	business	Proteus_TGV	, giving money
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	115	direction	business	Speed_TGV	, giving money
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	116	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	117	direction	business	Speed_TGV	, looking at the money
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	118	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Truly, sir, I think you’ll hardly win her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	119	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	120	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter. And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as steel.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	121	speech	prose	Proteus_TGV	What said she? Nothing?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	122	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	No, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.” To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned me. In requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I’ll commend you to my master.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	123	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Go, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	124	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	125	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Being destined to a drier death on shore.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	126	direction	exit	Speed_TGV	Speed exits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	127	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I must go send some better messenger.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	128	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	129	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Receiving them from such a worthless post.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	1	130	direction	exit	Proteus_TGV	He exits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	131	direction	entrance	Julia_TGV	Enter Julia and Lucetta.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	131	direction	entrance	Lucetta_TGV	Enter Julia and Lucetta.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	132	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	133	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	134	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	135	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	136	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	That every day with parle encounter me,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	137	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	138	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Please you repeat their names, I’ll show my mind
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	139	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	According to my shallow simple skill.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	140	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What think’st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	141	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	142	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	But, were I you, he never should be mine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	143	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What think’st thou of the rich Mercatio?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	144	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Well of his wealth, but of himself so-so.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	145	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What think’st thou of the gentle Proteus?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	146	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Lord, Lord, to see what folly reigns in us!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	147	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	How now? What means this passion at his name?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	148	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Pardon, dear madam, ’tis a passing shame
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	149	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	That I, unworthy body as I am,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	150	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	151	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	152	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Then thus: of many good, I think him best.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	153	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Your reason?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	154	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	I have no other but a woman’s reason:
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	155	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	I think him so because I think him so.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	156	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	157	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	158	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Why, he of all the rest hath never moved me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	159	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Yet he of all the rest I think best loves you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	160	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	His little speaking shows his love but small.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	161	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	162	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	They do not love that do not show their love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	163	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	O, they love least that let men know their love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	164	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	I would I knew his mind.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	165	direction	business	Julia_TGV	, handing her a paper
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	166	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Peruse this paper, madam.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	167	direction	delivery	Julia_TGV	reads
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	168	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	“To Julia.”—Say from whom.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	169	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	That the contents will show.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	170	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Say, say who gave it thee.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	171	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Sir Valentine’s page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	172	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	173	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Did in your name receive it. Pardon the fault, I pray.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	174	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	175	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	176	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	177	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Now trust me, ’tis an office of great worth,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	178	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And you an officer fit for the place.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	179	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	There, take the paper; see it be returned,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	180	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Or else return no more into my sight.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	181	direction	business	Lucetta_TGV	, taking the paper
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	182	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	183	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Will you be gone?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	184	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	That you may ruminate.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	185	direction	exit	Lucetta_TGV	She exits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	186	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And yet I would I had o’erlooked the letter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	187	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	It were a shame to call her back again
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	188	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	189	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What fool is she that knows I am a maid
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	190	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And would not force the letter to my view,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	191	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Since maids in modesty say “no” to that
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	192	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Which they would have the profferer construe “ay”!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	193	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	194	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	195	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	196	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	197	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	When willingly I would have had her here!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	198	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	199	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	200	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	My penance is to call Lucetta back
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	201	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And ask remission for my folly past.—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	202	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What ho, Lucetta!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	203	direction	entrance	Lucetta_TGV	Enter Lucetta.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	204	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	What would your Ladyship?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	205	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Is ’t near dinner time?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	206	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	I would it were,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	207	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	That you might kill your stomach on your meat
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	208	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	And not upon your maid.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	209	direction	business	Lucetta_TGV	She drops a paper and then retrieves it.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	210	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What is ’t that you took up so gingerly?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	211	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Nothing.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	212	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Why didst thou stoop, then?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	213	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	To take a paper up that I let fall.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	214	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And is that paper nothing?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	215	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Nothing concerning me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	216	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	217	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	218	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Unless it have a false interpreter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	219	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	220	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	That I might sing it, madam, to a tune,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	221	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Give me a note. Your Ladyship can set—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	222	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	As little by such toys as may be possible.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	223	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Best sing it to the tune of “Light o’ Love.”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	224	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	It is too heavy for so light a tune.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	225	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	226	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	227	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And why not you?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	228	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	I cannot reach so high.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	235	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	You, minion, are too saucy.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	236	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Nay, now you are too flat
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	237	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	And mar the concord with too harsh a descant.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	2	239	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	The mean is drowned with your unruly bass.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	3	295	speech	verse	Pantino_TGV	Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	3	296	speech	verse	Pantino_TGV	While other men, of slender reputation,

Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	3	304	speech	verse	Pantino_TGV	To let him spend his time no more at home,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	3	305	speech	verse	Pantino_TGV	Which would be great impeachment to his age

Two Gentlemen of Verona	1	3	309	speech	verse	Antonio_TGV	I have considered well his loss of time

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	398	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	She is not within hearing, sir.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	399	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Why, sir, who bade you call her?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	400	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Your Worship, sir, or else I mistook.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	401	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Well, you’ll still be too forward.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	402	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	403	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Sylvia?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	404	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	She that your Worship loves?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	405	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Why, how know you that I am in love?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	406	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms like a malcontent; to relish a love song like a robin redbreast; to walk alone like one that had the pestilence; to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his ABC; to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast like one that takes diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions. When you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money. And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	407	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Are all these things perceived in me?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	408	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	They are all perceived without you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	409	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Without me? They cannot.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	410	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Without you? Nay, that’s certain, for without you were so simple, none else would. But you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	411	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	But tell me, dost thou know my Lady Sylvia?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	412	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	413	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Hast thou observed that? Even she I mean.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	414	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Why, sir, I know her not.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	415	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet know’st her not?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	416	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Is she not hard-favored, sir?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	417	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Not so fair, boy, as well-favored.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	418	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Sir, I know that well enough.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	419	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	What dost thou know?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	420	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favored.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	421	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favor infinite.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	422	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	That’s because the one is painted, and the other out of all count.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	423	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	How painted? And how out of count?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	424	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	425	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	How esteem’st thou me? I account of her beauty.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	426	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	You never saw her since she was deformed.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	427	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	How long hath she been deformed?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	428	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Ever since you loved her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	429	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	430	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	If you love her, you cannot see her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	431	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Why?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	432	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Because love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	433	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	What should I see then?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	434	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	435	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Belike, boy, then you are in love, for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	436	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	True, sir, I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	437	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	438	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	439	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	440	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	And have you?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	441	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	I have.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	442	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Are they not lamely writ?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	443	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace, here she comes.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	458	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	I thank you, gentle servant, ’tis very clerkly done.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	459	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	460	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	For, being ignorant to whom it goes,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	1	461	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	I writ at random, very doubtfully.

I have received my proportion like the Prodigious Son and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial’s court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I’ll show you the manner of it.

Now sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the dog is himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I am myself. Ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: “Father, your blessing.” Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my father. Well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O, that she could speak now like a wold woman! Well, I kiss her.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	3	572	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the service, and the tied. Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	611	speech	prose	Valentine_TGV	Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your Ladyship’s looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	612	speech	prose	Thurio_TGV	Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	662	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	Nay, then, he should be blind, and being blind
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	663	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	How could he see his way to seek out you?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	664	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Why, lady, love hath twenty pair of eyes.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	665	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	666	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	667	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Upon a homely object, Love can wink.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	668	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	670	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Welcome, dear Proteus.—Mistress, I beseech you
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	671	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Confirm his welcome with some special favor.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	672	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	673	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	If this be he you oft have wished to hear from.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	674	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Mistress, it is. Sweet lady, entertain him
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	675	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To be my fellow-servant to your Ladyship.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	676	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	677	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	678	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	679	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Leave off discourse of disability.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	680	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	681	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	682	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	And duty never yet did want his meed.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	683	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	684	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I’ll die on him that says so but yourself.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	685	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	That you are welcome?

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	691	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	Go with me.—Once more, new servant, welcome.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	692	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	I’ll leave you to confer of home affairs.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	693	speech	verse	Sylvia_TGV	When you have done, we look to hear from you.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	696	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Now tell me, how do all from whence you came?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	697	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Your friends are well and have them much commended.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	698	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And how do yours?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	699	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I left them all in health.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	700	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	How does your lady? And how thrives your love?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	701	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	My tales of love were wont to weary you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	702	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I know you joy not in a love discourse.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	703	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	704	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	I have done penance for contemning Love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	705	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	706	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	707	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	With nightly tears, and daily heartsore sighs,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	708	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	For in revenge of my contempt of love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	709	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Love hath chased sleep from my enthrallèd eyes
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	710	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And made them watchers of mine own heart’s sorrow.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	711	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	O gentle Proteus, Love’s a mighty lord
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	712	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And hath so humbled me as I confess
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	713	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	There is no woe to his correction,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	714	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Nor, to his service, no such joy on Earth.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	715	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Now, no discourse except it be of love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	716	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	717	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Upon the very naked name of Love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	718	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	719	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Was this the idol that you worship so?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	720	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Even she. And is she not a heavenly saint?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	721	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	No, but she is an earthly paragon.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	722	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Call her divine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	723	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I will not flatter her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	724	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	O, flatter me, for love delights in praises.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	725	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	726	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And I must minister the like to you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	727	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	728	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Yet let her be a principality,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	729	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Sovereign to all the creatures on the Earth.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	730	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Except my mistress.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	731	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Sweet, except not any,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	732	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Except thou wilt except against my love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	733	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	734	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And I will help thee to prefer her too:
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	735	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	She shall be dignified with this high honor—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	736	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To bear my lady’s train, lest the base earth
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	737	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	738	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And, of so great a favor growing proud,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	739	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	740	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And make rough winter everlastingly.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	741	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Why, Valentine, what braggartism is this?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	742	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	743	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	744	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	She is alone—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	745	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Then let her alone.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	746	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	747	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And I as rich in having such a jewel
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	748	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	749	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	750	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	751	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Because thou seest me dote upon my love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	752	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	My foolish rival, that her father likes
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	753	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Only for his possessions are so huge,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	754	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Is gone with her along, and I must after,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	755	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	For love, thou know’st, is full of jealousy.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	756	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But she loves you?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	757	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Ay, and we are betrothed; nay more, our marriage hour,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	758	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	With all the cunning manner of our flight
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	759	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Determined of: how I must climb her window,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	760	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	The ladder made of cords, and all the means
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	761	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Plotted and ’greed on for my happiness.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	762	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	763	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	764	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Go on before. I shall inquire you forth.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	765	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I must unto the road to disembark
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	766	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Some necessaries that I needs must use,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	767	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And then I’ll presently attend you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	768	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Will you make haste?

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	770	direction	exit	Speed_TGV	Valentine and Speed exit.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	771	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Even as one heat another heat expels,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	772	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	773	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	So the remembrance of my former love
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	774	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	775	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Is it mine eye, or Valentine’s praise,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	776	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	777	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	778	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	She is fair, and so is Julia that I love—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	779	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That I did love, for now my love is thawed,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	780	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Which like a waxen image ’gainst a fire
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	781	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Bears no impression of the thing it was.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	782	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	783	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And that I love him not as I was wont.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	784	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	O, but I love his lady too too much,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	785	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And that’s the reason I love him so little.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	786	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	How shall I dote on her with more advice
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	787	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That thus without advice begin to love her?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	788	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	789	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And that hath dazzled my reason’s light;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	790	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But when I look on her perfections,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	791	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	There is no reason but I shall be blind.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	792	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	If I can check my erring love, I will;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	4	793	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	If not, to compass her I’ll use my skill.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	796	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Lance, by mine honesty, welcome to Padua.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	797	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always: that a man is never undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the Hostess say welcome.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	798	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Come on, you madcap. I’ll to the alehouse with you presently, where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	799	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	800	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	But shall she marry him?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	801	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	No.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	802	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	How then? Shall he marry her?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	803	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	No, neither.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	804	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	What, are they broken?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	805	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	No, they are both as whole as a fish.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	806	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Why then, how stands the matter with them?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	807	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well with her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	808	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	809	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	What a block art thou that thou canst not! My staff understands me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	810	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	What thou sayst?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	811	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Ay, and what I do too. Look thee, I’ll but lean, and my staff understands me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	812	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	It stands under thee indeed.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	813	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Why, “stand under” and “understand” is all one.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	814	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	But tell me true, will ’t be a match?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	815	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Ask my dog. If he say “Ay,” it will; if he say “No,” it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	816	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	The conclusion is, then, that it will.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	817	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	818	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	’Tis well that I get it so. But, Lance, how sayst thou that my master is become a notable lover?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	819	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	I never knew him otherwise.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	820	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Than how?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	821	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	822	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak’st me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	823	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	824	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	825	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	826	speech	prose	Speed_TGV	Why?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	5	827	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	831	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	832	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To love fair Sylvia, shall I be forsworn.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	833	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	834	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And ev’n that power which gave me first my oath
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	835	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Provokes me to this threefold perjury.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	836	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Love bade me swear, and love bids me forswear.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	837	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	838	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	839	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	At first I did adore a twinkling star,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	840	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But now I worship a celestial sun;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	841	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	842	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And he wants wit that wants resolvèd will
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	843	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To learn his wit t’ exchange the bad for better.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	844	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Fie, fie, unreverend tongue, to call her bad
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	845	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	846	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	847	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I cannot leave to love, and yet I do.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	848	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But there I leave to love where I should love.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	849	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	850	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	851	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	If I lose them, thus find I by their loss:
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	852	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Sylvia.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	853	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I to myself am dearer than a friend,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	854	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For love is still most precious in itself,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	855	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And Sylvia—witness heaven that made her fair—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	856	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	857	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I will forget that Julia is alive,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	858	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Rememb’ring that my love to her is dead;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	859	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And Valentine I’ll hold an enemy,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	860	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Aiming at Sylvia as a sweeter friend.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	861	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I cannot now prove constant to myself
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	862	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Without some treachery used to Valentine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	863	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	864	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To climb celestial Sylvia’s chamber window,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	865	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Myself in counsel his competitor.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	866	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Now presently I’ll give her father notice
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	867	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Of their disguising and pretended flight,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	868	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	869	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	870	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But Valentine being gone, I’ll quickly cross
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	871	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	By some sly trick blunt Thurio’s dull proceeding.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	6	872	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	879	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Are visibly charactered and engraved—

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	881	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	How with my honor I may undertake
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	882	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	A journey to my loving Proteus.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	883	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Alas, the way is wearisome and long.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	884	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	885	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;

Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	887	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	888	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	889	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Better forbear till Proteus make return.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	890	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	O, know’st thou not his looks are my soul’s food?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	891	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Pity the dearth that I have pinèd in
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	892	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	By longing for that food so long a time.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	893	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	894	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	895	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	896	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	I do not seek to quench your love’s hot fire,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	897	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	But qualify the fire’s extreme rage,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	898	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	899	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	The more thou damm’st it up, the more it burns.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	900	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	The current that with gentle murmur glides,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	901	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Thou know’st, being stopped, impatiently doth rage,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	902	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	But when his fair course is not hinderèd,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	903	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	He makes sweet music with th’ enameled stones,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	904	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	905	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	906	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And so by many winding nooks he strays
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	907	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	With willing sport to the wild ocean.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	908	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Then let me go and hinder not my course.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	909	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	910	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And make a pastime of each weary step
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	911	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Till the last step have brought me to my love,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	912	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And there I’ll rest as after much turmoil
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	913	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	A blessèd soul doth in Elysium.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	914	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	But in what habit will you go along?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	915	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Not like a woman, for I would prevent
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	916	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	The loose encounters of lascivious men.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	917	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	918	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	As may beseem some well-reputed page.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	919	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Why, then, your Ladyship must cut your hair.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	920	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	No, girl, I’ll knit it up in silken strings
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	921	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	922	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	To be fantastic may become a youth
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	923	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Of greater time than I shall show to be.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	924	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	925	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	That fits as well as “Tell me, good my lord,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	926	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What compass will you wear your farthingale?”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	927	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Why, ev’n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	928	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	929	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Out, out, Lucetta. That will be ill-favored.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	930	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	A round hose, madam, now’s not worth a pin
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	931	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	932	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Lucetta, as thou lov’st me, let me have
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	933	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	What thou think’st meet and is most mannerly.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	934	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	935	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	936	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	I fear me it will make me scandalized.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	937	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	938	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Nay, that I will not.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	939	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Then never dream on infamy, but go.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	940	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	If Proteus like your journey when you come,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	941	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	No matter who’s displeased when you are gone.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	942	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	943	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	944	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	945	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And instances of infinite of love
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	946	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	947	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	All these are servants to deceitful men.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	948	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Base men that use them to so base effect!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	949	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	But truer stars did govern Proteus’ birth.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	950	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	951	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	952	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	953	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	His heart as far from fraud as heaven from Earth.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	954	speech	verse	Lucetta_TGV	Pray heav’n he prove so when you come to him.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	955	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Now, as thou lov’st me, do him not that wrong
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	956	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	To bear a hard opinion of his truth.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	957	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Only deserve my love by loving him.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	958	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	And presently go with me to my chamber
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	959	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	To take a note of what I stand in need of
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	960	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	To furnish me upon my longing journey.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	961	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	962	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	My goods, my lands, my reputation.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	963	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	964	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	Come, answer not, but to it presently.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	2	7	965	speech	verse	Julia_TGV	I am impatient of my tarriance.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	967	direction	entrance	Proteus_TGV	Enter Duke, Thurio, and Proteus.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	968	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	969	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	We have some secrets to confer about.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	970	direction	exit	Thurio_TGV	Thurio exits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	971	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Now tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	972	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	My gracious lord, that which I would discover
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	973	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	The law of friendship bids me to conceal,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	974	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But when I call to mind your gracious favors
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	975	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Done to me, undeserving as I am,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	976	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	My duty pricks me on to utter that
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	977	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	978	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	979	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	This night intends to steal away your daughter;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	980	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Myself am one made privy to the plot.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	981	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	I know you have determined to bestow her
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	982	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	983	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And should she thus be stol’n away from you,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	984	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	It would be much vexation to your age.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	985	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	986	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	To cross my friend in his intended drift
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	987	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	988	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	989	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	990	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	991	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Which to requite command me while I live.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	992	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	993	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	994	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	995	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Sir Valentine her company and my court.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	996	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	997	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And so, unworthily, disgrace the man—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	998	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	A rashness that I ever yet have shunned—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	999	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1000	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1001	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1002	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1003	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1004	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	The key whereof myself have ever kept,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1005	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And thence she cannot be conveyed away.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1006	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1007	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	How he her chamber-window will ascend
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1008	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1009	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For which the youthful lover now is gone,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1010	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And this way comes he with it presently,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1011	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1012	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1013	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That my discovery be not aimèd at;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1014	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1015	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Hath made me publisher of this pretense.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1016	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Upon mine honor, he shall never know
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1017	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That I had any light from thee of this.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1018	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Adieu, my lord. Sir Valentine is coming.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1019	direction	exit	Proteus_TGV	Proteus exits.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1020	direction	entrance	Valentine_TGV	Enter Valentine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1021	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1022	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1023	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1024	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And I am going to deliver them.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1025	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Be they of much import?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1026	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	The tenor of them doth but signify
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1027	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	My health and happy being at your court.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1028	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1029	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I am to break with thee of some affairs
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1030	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1031	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1032	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1033	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	I know it well, my lord, and sure the match
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1034	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Were rich and honorable. Besides, the gentleman
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1035	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1036	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1037	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1038	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	No. Trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1039	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1040	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Neither regarding that she is my child
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1041	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1042	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1043	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1044	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And where I thought the remnant of mine age
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1045	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Should have been cherished by her childlike duty,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1046	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I now am full resolved to take a wife
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1047	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And turn her out to who will take her in.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1048	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Then let her beauty be her wedding dower,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1049	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	For me and my possessions she esteems not.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1050	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	What would your Grace have me to do in this?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1051	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	There is a lady in Verona here
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1052	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Whom I affect; but she is nice, and coy,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1053	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And nought esteems my agèd eloquence.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1054	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1055	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	For long agone I have forgot to court;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1056	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Besides, the fashion of the time is changed—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1057	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	How and which way I may bestow myself
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1058	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1059	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Win her with gifts if she respect not words;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1060	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1061	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	More than quick words do move a woman’s mind.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1062	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1063	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1064	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Send her another; never give her o’er,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1065	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1066	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1067	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	But rather to beget more love in you.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1068	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1069	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1070	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1071	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	For “get you gone” she doth not mean “away.”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1072	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1073	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1074	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1075	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1076	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	But she I mean is promised by her friends
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1077	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Unto a youthful gentleman of worth
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1078	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And kept severely from resort of men,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1079	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That no man hath access by day to her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1080	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1081	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1082	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That no man hath recourse to her by night.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1083	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	What lets but one may enter at her window?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1084	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1085	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1086	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Without apparent hazard of his life.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1087	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Why, then a ladder quaintly made of cords
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1088	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1089	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Would serve to scale another Hero’s tower,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1090	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	So bold Leander would adventure it.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1091	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1092	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1093	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	When would you use it? Pray sir, tell me that.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1094	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	This very night; for love is like a child
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1095	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That longs for everything that he can come by.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1096	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1097	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	But hark thee: I will go to her alone;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1098	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1099	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1100	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Under a cloak that is of any length.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1101	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1102	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Ay, my good lord.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1103	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Then let me see thy cloak;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1104	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I’ll get me one of such another length.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1105	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1106	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1107	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1108	direction	business	Duke_TGV	Pulling off the cloak, he reveals a rope ladder and a paper.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1108	direction	business	Valentine_TGV	Pulling off the cloak, he reveals a rope ladder and a paper.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1109	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	What letter is this same? What’s here?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1110	direction	delivery	Duke_TGV	(Reads.)
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1111	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1112	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1115	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And slaves they are to me that send them flying.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1116	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	O, could their master come and go as lightly,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1117	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1118	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1120	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1121	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Because myself do want my servants’ fortune.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1122	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1123	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	That they should harbor where their lord should be.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1127	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	’Tis so. And here’s the ladder for the purpose.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1128	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Why, Phaëton—for thou art Merops’ son—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1129	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1130	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And with thy daring folly burn the world?

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1134	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1135	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Is privilege for thy departure hence.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1136	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Thank me for this more than for all the favors
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1137	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Which all too much I have bestowed on thee.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1146	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And why not death, rather than living torment?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1147	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	To die is to be banished from myself,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1148	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And Sylvia is myself; banished from her
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1149	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Is self from self—a deadly banishment.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1182	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	So much of bad already hath possessed them.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1183	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1195	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	O, I have fed upon this woe already,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1196	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1197	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Doth Sylvia know that I am banishèd?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1198	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Ay, ay, and she hath offered to the doom—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1199	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Which unreversed stands in effectual force—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1200	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1203	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1204	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	As if but now they waxèd pale for woe.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1205	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1206	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1207	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1208	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But Valentine, if he be ta’en, must die.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1209	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1210	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1211	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That to close prison he commanded her

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1213	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	No more, unless the next word that thou speak’st
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1214	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	Have some malignant power upon my life.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1215	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1216	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	As ending anthem of my endless dolor.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1218	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And study help for that which thou lament’st.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1220	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1221	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1222	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Hope is a lover’s staff; walk hence with that

He lives not now that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who ’tis I love; and yet ’tis a woman, but what woman I will not tell myself; and yet ’tis a milk-maid; yet ’tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet ’tis a maid, for she is her master’s maid and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water spaniel, which is much in a bare Christian.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1262	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	That’s as much as to say “Can she so?”
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1263	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock?

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1266	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	That’s as much as to say “bastard virtues,” that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1272	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue. I pray thee, out with ’t, and place it for her chief virtue.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1273	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Out with that too; it was Eve’s legacy and cannot be ta’en from her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1274	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1275	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1276	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will, for good things should be praised.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1277	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Of her tongue she cannot, for that’s writ down she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I’ll keep shut; now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1278	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Stop there. I’ll have her. She was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1279	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	? It may be; I’ll prove it: the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less. What’s next?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1280	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	That’s monstrous! O, that that were out!
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	1	1281	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I’ll have her, and if it be a match, as nothing is impossible—

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1298	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	That I am desperate of obtaining her.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1299	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	This weak impress of love is as a figure

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1310	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1313	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Makes me the better to confer with thee.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1322	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1323	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	What might we do to make the girl forget
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1324	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1325	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	The best way is to slander Valentine
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1326	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1327	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Three things that women highly hold in hate.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1328	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Ay, but she’ll think that it is spoke in hate.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1329	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Ay, if his enemy deliver it.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1330	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1331	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1332	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Then you must undertake to slander him.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1333	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1334	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	’Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1335	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Especially against his very friend.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1336	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Where your good word cannot advantage him,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1337	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Your slander never can endamage him;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1338	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Therefore the office is indifferent,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1339	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Being entreated to it by your friend.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1340	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1341	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1342	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	She shall not long continue love to him.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1343	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But say this weed her love from Valentine,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1344	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1345	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1346	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1347	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	You must provide to bottom it on me,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1348	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	Which must be done by praising me as much
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1349	speech	verse	Thurio_TGV	As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1350	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1351	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Because we know, on Valentine’s report,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1352	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	You are already Love’s firm votary
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1353	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1354	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Upon this warrant shall you have access
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1355	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Where you with Sylvia may confer at large—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1356	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1357	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	And, for your friend’s sake, will be glad of you—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1358	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Where you may temper her by your persuasion
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1359	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1360	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	As much as I can do I will effect.—
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1361	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1362	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	You must lay lime to tangle her desires
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1363	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	By wailful sonnets, whose composèd rhymes
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1364	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1365	speech	verse	Duke_TGV	Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1366	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Say that upon the altar of her beauty
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1367	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1368	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1369	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1370	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	That may discover such integrity.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1371	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1372	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1373	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1374	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1375	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	After your dire-lamenting elegies,

Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1378	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Tune a deploring dump; the night’s dead silence
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1379	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	Will well become such sweet complaining grievance.
Two Gentlemen of Verona	3	2	1380	speech	verse	Proteus_TGV	This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

Two Gentlemen of Verona	4	1	1422	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	For that which now torments me to rehearse;
Two Gentlemen of Verona	4	1	1423	speech	verse	Valentine_TGV	I killed a man, whose death I much repent,

Two Gentlemen of Verona	4	4	1692	speech	prose	Lance_TGV	When a man’s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard—one that I brought up of a puppy, one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him even as one would say precisely “Thus I would teach a dog.” I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Sylvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon’s leg. O, ’tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed; to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for ’t. Sure as I live, he had suffered for ’t. You shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke’s table; he had not been there—bless the mark!—a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him. “Out with the dog!” says one. “What cur is that?” says another. “Whip him out!” says the third. “Hang him up!” says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. “Friend,” quoth I, “You mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry, do I,” quoth he. “You do him the more wrong,” quoth I. “’Twas I did the thing you wot of.” He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen; otherwise he had been executed. I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed; otherwise he had suffered for ’t. Thou think’st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Sylvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?
