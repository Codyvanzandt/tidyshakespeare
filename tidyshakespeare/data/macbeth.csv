Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on th’ expectation of plenty. Come in time! Have napkins enough about you; here you’ll sweat for ’t. Knock, knock! Who’s there, in th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator. Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here you may roast your goose. Knock, knock! Never at quiet.—What are you?—But this place is too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further.

Macbeth	2	3	758	speech	prose	Porter_Mac	Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
Macbeth	2	3	759	speech	prose	Macduff_Mac	What three things does drink especially provoke?
Macbeth	2	3	760	speech	prose	Porter_Mac	Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

Macbeth	3	1	1026	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	My genius is rebuked, as it is said
Macbeth	3	1	1027	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
Macbeth	3	1	1028	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	When first they put the name of king upon me
Macbeth	3	1	1029	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	And bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like,

Macbeth	3	1	1031	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown

Macbeth	3	1	1048	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_Mac	It was, so please your Highness.
Macbeth	3	1	1049	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Well then, now
Macbeth	3	1	1050	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Have you considered of my speeches? Know
Macbeth	3	1	1051	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	That it was he, in the times past, which held you
Macbeth	3	1	1052	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	So under fortune, which you thought had been
Macbeth	3	1	1053	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Our innocent self. This I made good to you
Macbeth	3	1	1054	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	In our last conference, passed in probation with you
Macbeth	3	1	1055	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments,
Macbeth	3	1	1056	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
Macbeth	3	1	1057	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Macbeth	3	1	1058	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Say “Thus did Banquo.”
Macbeth	3	1	1059	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_Mac	You made it known to us.
Macbeth	3	1	1060	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	I did so, and went further, which is now
Macbeth	3	1	1061	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Macbeth	3	1	1062	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Your patience so predominant in your nature
Macbeth	3	1	1063	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	That you can let this go? Are you so gospeled
Macbeth	3	1	1064	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Macbeth	3	1	1065	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave
Macbeth	3	1	1066	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	And beggared yours forever?
Macbeth	3	1	1067	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_Mac	We are men, my liege.
Macbeth	3	1	1068	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Ay, in the catalogue you go for men,
Macbeth	3	1	1069	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Macbeth	3	1	1070	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept
Macbeth	3	1	1071	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Macbeth	3	1	1072	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
Macbeth	3	1	1073	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
Macbeth	3	1	1074	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	According to the gift which bounteous nature
Macbeth	3	1	1075	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Macbeth	3	1	1076	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Particular addition, from the bill
Macbeth	3	1	1077	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	That writes them all alike. And so of men.
Macbeth	3	1	1078	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Now, if you have a station in the file,
Macbeth	3	1	1079	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say ’t,
Macbeth	3	1	1080	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	And I will put that business in your bosoms
Macbeth	3	1	1081	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Macbeth	3	1	1082	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Macbeth	3	1	1083	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Macbeth	3	1	1084	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Which in his death were perfect.
Macbeth	3	1	1085	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_Mac	I am one, my liege,
Macbeth	3	1	1086	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_Mac	Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world

Macbeth	3	1	1089	speech	verse	MURDERERS.1_Mac	And I another

Macbeth	3	1	1095	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_Mac	True, my lord.
Macbeth	3	1	1096	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	So is he mine, and in such bloody distance
Macbeth	3	1	1097	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	That every minute of his being thrusts
Macbeth	3	1	1098	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Against my near’st of life. And though I could
Macbeth	3	1	1099	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
Macbeth	3	1	1100	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
Macbeth	3	1	1101	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Macbeth	3	1	1102	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Macbeth	3	1	1103	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Who I myself struck down. And thence it is
Macbeth	3	1	1104	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	That I to your assistance do make love,
Macbeth	3	1	1105	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	Masking the business from the common eye
Macbeth	3	1	1106	speech	verse	Macbeth_Mac	For sundry weighty reasons.
Macbeth	3	1	1107	speech	verse	MURDERERS.2_Mac	We shall, my lord,

Macbeth	4	3	1850	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Be not offended.
Macbeth	4	3	1851	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
Macbeth	4	3	1852	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.
Macbeth	4	3	1853	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
Macbeth	4	3	1854	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Is added to her wounds. I think withal
Macbeth	4	3	1855	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	There would be hands uplifted in my right;
Macbeth	4	3	1856	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	And here from gracious England have I offer
Macbeth	4	3	1857	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,
Macbeth	4	3	1858	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head
Macbeth	4	3	1859	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Macbeth	4	3	1860	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Shall have more vices than it had before,

Macbeth	4	3	1862	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	By him that shall succeed.
Macbeth	4	3	1863	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	What should he be?
Macbeth	4	3	1864	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	It is myself I mean, in whom I know
Macbeth	4	3	1865	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	All the particulars of vice so grafted
Macbeth	4	3	1866	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth
Macbeth	4	3	1867	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state

Macbeth	4	3	1871	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned

Macbeth	4	3	1873	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I grant him bloody,
Macbeth	4	3	1874	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Macbeth	4	3	1875	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
Macbeth	4	3	1876	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	That has a name. But there’s no bottom, none,
Macbeth	4	3	1877	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,
Macbeth	4	3	1878	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
Macbeth	4	3	1879	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	The cistern of my lust, and my desire
Macbeth	4	3	1880	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	All continent impediments would o’erbear
Macbeth	4	3	1881	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth
Macbeth	4	3	1882	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Than such an one to reign.
Macbeth	4	3	1883	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Boundless intemperance
Macbeth	4	3	1884	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	In nature is a tyranny. It hath been
Macbeth	4	3	1885	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne
Macbeth	4	3	1886	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
Macbeth	4	3	1887	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	To take upon you what is yours. You may
Macbeth	4	3	1888	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
Macbeth	4	3	1889	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.

Macbeth	4	3	1893	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Finding it so inclined.
Macbeth	4	3	1894	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	With this there grows
Macbeth	4	3	1895	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	In my most ill-composed affection such
Macbeth	4	3	1896	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
Macbeth	4	3	1897	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Macbeth	4	3	1898	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Desire his jewels, and this other’s house;
Macbeth	4	3	1899	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	And my more-having would be as a sauce
Macbeth	4	3	1900	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	To make me hunger more, that I should forge
Macbeth	4	3	1901	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Macbeth	4	3	1902	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Destroying them for wealth.
Macbeth	4	3	1903	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	This avarice
Macbeth	4	3	1904	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Macbeth	4	3	1905	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
Macbeth	4	3	1906	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear.
Macbeth	4	3	1907	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
Macbeth	4	3	1908	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Of your mere own. All these are portable,
Macbeth	4	3	1909	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	With other graces weighed.
Macbeth	4	3	1910	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	But I have none. The king-becoming graces,
Macbeth	4	3	1911	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,
Macbeth	4	3	1912	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Macbeth	4	3	1913	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
Macbeth	4	3	1914	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I have no relish of them but abound
Macbeth	4	3	1915	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	In the division of each several crime,
Macbeth	4	3	1916	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Macbeth	4	3	1917	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Macbeth	4	3	1918	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Uproar the universal peace, confound
Macbeth	4	3	1919	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	All unity on earth.
Macbeth	4	3	1920	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	O Scotland, Scotland!
Macbeth	4	3	1921	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
Macbeth	4	3	1922	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I am as I have spoken.
Macbeth	4	3	1923	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Fit to govern?
Macbeth	4	3	1924	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	No, not to live.—O nation miserable,
Macbeth	4	3	1925	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,
Macbeth	4	3	1926	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Macbeth	4	3	1927	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Since that the truest issue of thy throne
Macbeth	4	3	1928	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	By his own interdiction stands accursed
Macbeth	4	3	1929	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And does blaspheme his breed?—Thy royal father
Macbeth	4	3	1930	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
Macbeth	4	3	1931	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,
Macbeth	4	3	1932	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Died every day she lived. Fare thee well.
Macbeth	4	3	1933	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
Macbeth	4	3	1934	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Hath banished me from Scotland.—O my breast,
Macbeth	4	3	1935	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Thy hope ends here!
Macbeth	4	3	1936	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Macduff, this noble passion,
Macbeth	4	3	1937	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Macbeth	4	3	1938	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
Macbeth	4	3	1939	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
Macbeth	4	3	1940	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Macbeth	4	3	1941	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
Macbeth	4	3	1942	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	From overcredulous haste. But God above
Macbeth	4	3	1943	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Deal between thee and me, for even now
Macbeth	4	3	1944	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	I put myself to thy direction and
Macbeth	4	3	1945	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
Macbeth	4	3	1946	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	The taints and blames I laid upon myself
Macbeth	4	3	1947	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	For strangers to my nature. I am yet

Macbeth	4	3	1950	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	At no time broke my faith, would not betray
Macbeth	4	3	1951	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	The devil to his fellow, and delight
Macbeth	4	3	1952	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	No less in truth than life. My first false speaking
Macbeth	4	3	1953	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Was this upon myself. What I am truly
Macbeth	4	3	1954	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Is thine and my poor country’s to command—

Macbeth	4	3	1956	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,
Macbeth	4	3	1957	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Already at a point, was setting forth.
Macbeth	4	3	1958	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness
Macbeth	4	3	1959	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
Macbeth	4	3	1960	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Such welcome and unwelcome things at once

Macbeth	4	3	1975	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Which often since my here-remain in England

Macbeth	4	3	1995	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Alas, poor country,

Macbeth	4	3	1997	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing

Macbeth	4	3	1999	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
Macbeth	4	3	2000	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems
Macbeth	4	3	2001	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell

Macbeth	4	3	2011	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And all my children?
Macbeth	4	3	2012	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Well too.
Macbeth	4	3	2013	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	The tyrant has not battered at their peace?
Macbeth	4	3	2014	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	No, they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.
Macbeth	4	3	2015	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Be not a niggard of your speech. How goes ’t?
Macbeth	4	3	2016	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	When I came hither to transport the tidings
Macbeth	4	3	2017	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
Macbeth	4	3	2018	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Macbeth	4	3	2019	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
Macbeth	4	3	2020	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.
Macbeth	4	3	2021	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
Macbeth	4	3	2022	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Would create soldiers, make our women fight
Macbeth	4	3	2023	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	To doff their dire distresses.
Macbeth	4	3	2024	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Be ’t their comfort
Macbeth	4	3	2025	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
Macbeth	4	3	2026	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;

Macbeth	4	3	2028	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	That Christendom gives out.
Macbeth	4	3	2029	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Would I could answer
Macbeth	4	3	2030	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	This comfort with the like. But I have words
Macbeth	4	3	2031	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	That would be howled out in the desert air,
Macbeth	4	3	2032	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Where hearing should not latch them.
Macbeth	4	3	2033	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	What concern they—
Macbeth	4	3	2034	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	The general cause, or is it a fee-grief
Macbeth	4	3	2035	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Due to some single breast?
Macbeth	4	3	2036	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	No mind that’s honest
Macbeth	4	3	2037	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	But in it shares some woe, though the main part
Macbeth	4	3	2038	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Pertains to you alone.
Macbeth	4	3	2039	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	If it be mine,
Macbeth	4	3	2040	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.
Macbeth	4	3	2041	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
Macbeth	4	3	2042	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
Macbeth	4	3	2043	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	That ever yet they heard.
Macbeth	4	3	2044	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Hum! I guess at it.
Macbeth	4	3	2045	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes
Macbeth	4	3	2046	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner
Macbeth	4	3	2047	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Were on the quarry of these murdered deer
Macbeth	4	3	2048	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	To add the death of you.
Macbeth	4	3	2049	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Merciful heaven!—
Macbeth	4	3	2050	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.
Macbeth	4	3	2051	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
Macbeth	4	3	2052	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break.
Macbeth	4	3	2053	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	My children too?
Macbeth	4	3	2054	speech	verse	Ross_Mac	Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.
Macbeth	4	3	2055	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And I must be from thence? My wife killed too?

Macbeth	4	3	2061	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Did you say “all”? O hell-kite! All?
Macbeth	4	3	2062	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
Macbeth	4	3	2063	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	At one fell swoop?
Macbeth	4	3	2064	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Dispute it like a man.
Macbeth	4	3	2065	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	I shall do so,
Macbeth	4	3	2066	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	But I must also feel it as a man.
Macbeth	4	3	2067	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	I cannot but remember such things were
Macbeth	4	3	2068	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on
Macbeth	4	3	2069	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
Macbeth	4	3	2070	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
Macbeth	4	3	2071	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Macbeth	4	3	2072	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.
Macbeth	4	3	2073	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
Macbeth	4	3	2074	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.
Macbeth	4	3	2075	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
Macbeth	4	3	2076	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Macbeth	4	3	2077	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Cut short all intermission! Front to front
Macbeth	4	3	2078	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Macbeth	4	3	2079	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Within my sword’s length set him. If he ’scape,
Macbeth	4	3	2080	speech	verse	Macduff_Mac	Heaven forgive him too.
Macbeth	4	3	2081	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	This tune goes manly.
Macbeth	4	3	2082	speech	verse	Malcolm_Mac	Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;

Macbeth	5	1	2091	speech	prose	Doctor2_Mac	A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching. In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what at any time have you heard her say?
