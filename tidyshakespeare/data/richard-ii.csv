Richard II	1	1	6	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Richard II	1	1	7	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

Richard II	1	1	10	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice
Richard II	1	1	11	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Or worthily, as a good subject should,

Richard II	1	1	13	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	As near as I could sift him on that argument,
Richard II	1	1	14	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	On some apparent danger seen in him
Richard II	1	1	15	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Aimed at your Highness, no inveterate malice.

Richard II	1	1	24	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Many years of happy days befall
Richard II	1	1	25	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege.
Richard II	1	1	26	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Each day still better other’s happiness
Richard II	1	1	27	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,
Richard II	1	1	28	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Add an immortal title to your crown.
Richard II	1	1	29	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	We thank you both. Yet one but flatters us,
Richard II	1	1	30	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	As well appeareth by the cause you come:
Richard II	1	1	31	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.
Richard II	1	1	32	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Richard II	1	1	33	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
Richard II	1	1	34	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	First—heaven be the record to my speech!—
Richard II	1	1	35	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	In the devotion of a subject’s love,
Richard II	1	1	36	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Tend’ring the precious safety of my prince
Richard II	1	1	37	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And free from other misbegotten hate,
Richard II	1	1	38	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Come I appellant to this princely presence.—
Richard II	1	1	39	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee;
Richard II	1	1	40	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And mark my greeting well, for what I speak
Richard II	1	1	41	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	My body shall make good upon this earth
Richard II	1	1	42	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Richard II	1	1	43	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Richard II	1	1	44	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Richard II	1	1	45	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
Richard II	1	1	46	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Richard II	1	1	47	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
Richard II	1	1	48	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,
Richard II	1	1	49	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
Richard II	1	1	50	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	What my tongue speaks my right-drawn sword may prove.
Richard II	1	1	51	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.
Richard II	1	1	52	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,
Richard II	1	1	53	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,
Richard II	1	1	54	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain.
Richard II	1	1	55	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The blood is hot that must be cooled for this.
Richard II	1	1	56	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
Richard II	1	1	57	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	As to be hushed and naught at all to say.
Richard II	1	1	58	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me
Richard II	1	1	59	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,
Richard II	1	1	60	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Which else would post until it had returned
Richard II	1	1	61	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Richard II	1	1	62	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,
Richard II	1	1	63	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
Richard II	1	1	64	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I do defy him, and I spit at him,
Richard II	1	1	65	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Call him a slanderous coward and a villain,
Richard II	1	1	66	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Which to maintain I would allow him odds
Richard II	1	1	67	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
Richard II	1	1	68	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps
Richard II	1	1	69	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Or any other ground inhabitable
Richard II	1	1	70	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Wherever Englishman durst set his foot.
Richard II	1	1	71	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Meantime let this defend my loyalty:
Richard II	1	1	72	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
Richard II	1	1	73	direction	business	HenryIV_1H4	, throwing down a gage
Richard II	1	1	74	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Richard II	1	1	75	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Disclaiming here the kindred of the King,
Richard II	1	1	76	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,
Richard II	1	1	77	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
Richard II	1	1	78	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
Richard II	1	1	79	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As to take up mine honor’s pawn, then stoop.
Richard II	1	1	80	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	By that and all the rites of knighthood else
Richard II	1	1	81	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
Richard II	1	1	82	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise.
Richard II	1	1	83	direction	business	Mowbray_R2	, picking up the gage
Richard II	1	1	84	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I take it up, and by that sword I swear
Richard II	1	1	85	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
Richard II	1	1	86	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I’ll answer thee in any fair degree
Richard II	1	1	87	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;
Richard II	1	1	88	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And when I mount, alive may I not light
Richard II	1	1	89	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	If I be traitor or unjustly fight.
Richard II	1	1	90	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?
Richard II	1	1	91	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	It must be great that can inherit us
Richard II	1	1	92	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	So much as of a thought of ill in him.
Richard II	1	1	93	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:
Richard II	1	1	94	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
Richard II	1	1	95	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	In name of lendings for your Highness’ soldiers,
Richard II	1	1	96	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The which he hath detained for lewd employments,
Richard II	1	1	97	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Richard II	1	1	98	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Besides I say, and will in battle prove,
Richard II	1	1	99	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
Richard II	1	1	100	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That ever was surveyed by English eye,
Richard II	1	1	101	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Richard II	1	1	102	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Complotted and contrivèd in this land
Richard II	1	1	103	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Richard II	1	1	104	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Further I say, and further will maintain
Richard II	1	1	105	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Upon his bad life to make all this good,
Richard II	1	1	106	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,
Richard II	1	1	107	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
Richard II	1	1	108	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Richard II	1	1	109	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood,
Richard II	1	1	110	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries
Richard II	1	1	111	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
Richard II	1	1	112	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To me for justice and rough chastisement.
Richard II	1	1	113	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
Richard II	1	1	114	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
Richard II	1	1	115	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	How high a pitch his resolution soars!—
Richard II	1	1	116	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thomas of Norfolk, what sayst thou to this?
Richard II	1	1	117	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	O, let my sovereign turn away his face
Richard II	1	1	118	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Richard II	1	1	119	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Till I have told this slander of his blood
Richard II	1	1	120	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
Richard II	1	1	121	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.
Richard II	1	1	122	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,
Richard II	1	1	123	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	As he is but my father’s brother’s son,
Richard II	1	1	124	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Now by my scepter’s awe I make a vow:
Richard II	1	1	125	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood
Richard II	1	1	126	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Should nothing privilege him nor partialize
Richard II	1	1	127	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.
Richard II	1	1	128	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.
Richard II	1	1	129	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
Richard II	1	1	130	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Richard II	1	1	131	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Richard II	1	1	132	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Richard II	1	1	133	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Disbursed I duly to his Highness’ soldiers;
Richard II	1	1	134	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The other part reserved I by consent,
Richard II	1	1	135	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Richard II	1	1	136	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Upon remainder of a dear account
Richard II	1	1	137	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.
Richard II	1	1	138	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,
Richard II	1	1	139	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I slew him not, but to my own disgrace
Richard II	1	1	140	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Neglected my sworn duty in that case.—
Richard II	1	1	141	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
Richard II	1	1	142	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The honorable father to my foe,
Richard II	1	1	143	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
Richard II	1	1	144	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	A trespass that doth vex my grievèd soul.
Richard II	1	1	145	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	But ere I last received the sacrament,
Richard II	1	1	146	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I did confess it and exactly begged
Richard II	1	1	147	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Your Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.—
Richard II	1	1	148	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	This is my fault. As for the rest appealed,
Richard II	1	1	149	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	It issues from the rancor of a villain,
Richard II	1	1	150	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	A recreant and most degenerate traitor,
Richard II	1	1	151	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Which in myself I boldly will defend,
Richard II	1	1	152	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Richard II	1	1	153	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,
Richard II	1	1	154	direction	business	Mowbray_R2	He throws down a gage.
Richard II	1	1	155	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	To prove myself a loyal gentleman,
Richard II	1	1	156	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom;
Richard II	1	1	157	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	In haste whereof most heartily I pray
Richard II	1	1	158	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Your Highness to assign our trial day.
Richard II	1	1	159	direction	business	HenryIV_1H4	Bolingbroke picks up the gage.
Richard II	1	1	160	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me.
Richard II	1	1	161	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Let’s purge this choler without letting blood.
Richard II	1	1	162	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	This we prescribe, though no physician.
Richard II	1	1	163	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Deep malice makes too deep incision.
Richard II	1	1	164	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed.
Richard II	1	1	165	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.—
Richard II	1	1	166	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
Richard II	1	1	167	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
Richard II	1	1	168	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	To be a make-peace shall become my age.—
Richard II	1	1	169	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.
Richard II	1	1	170	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And, Norfolk, throw down his.
Richard II	1	1	171	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	When, Harry, when?
Richard II	1	1	172	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Obedience bids I should not bid again.
Richard II	1	1	173	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
Richard II	1	1	174	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
Richard II	1	1	175	direction	business	Mowbray_R2	Mowbray kneels.
Richard II	1	1	176	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	My life thou shalt command, but not my shame.
Richard II	1	1	177	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The one my duty owes, but my fair name,
Richard II	1	1	178	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
Richard II	1	1	179	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	To dark dishonor’s use thou shalt not have.
Richard II	1	1	180	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,
Richard II	1	1	181	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Pierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear,
Richard II	1	1	182	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
Richard II	1	1	183	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Which breathed this poison.
Richard II	1	1	184	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Rage must be withstood.

Richard II	1	1	188	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
Richard II	1	1	189	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The purest treasure mortal times afford
Richard II	1	1	190	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Is spotless reputation; that away,
Richard II	1	1	191	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
Richard II	1	1	192	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	A jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chest
Richard II	1	1	193	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Richard II	1	1	194	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Mine honor is my life; both grow in one.
Richard II	1	1	195	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Take honor from me and my life is done.
Richard II	1	1	196	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try.

Richard II	1	1	201	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Shall I seem crestfallen in my father’s sight?

Richard II	1	1	205	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
Richard II	1	1	206	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The slavish motive of recanting fear
Richard II	1	1	207	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,

Richard II	1	2	237	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,
Richard II	1	2	238	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Richard II	1	2	239	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	Is cracked and all the precious liquor spilt,

Richard II	1	2	241	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody ax.
Richard II	1	2	242	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,
Richard II	1	2	243	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	That metal, that self mold that fashioned thee

Richard II	1	2	247	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,

Richard II	1	2	256	speech	verse	DuchessOfGloucester_R2	The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.

Richard II	1	3	457	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
Richard II	1	3	458	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Your will be done. This must my comfort be:
Richard II	1	3	459	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,
Richard II	1	3	460	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And those his golden beams to you here lent
Richard II	1	3	461	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
Richard II	1	3	462	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Richard II	1	3	463	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
Richard II	1	3	464	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The sly, slow hours shall not determinate
Richard II	1	3	465	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The dateless limit of thy dear exile.
Richard II	1	3	466	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The hopeless word of “never to return”
Richard II	1	3	467	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
Richard II	1	3	468	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
Richard II	1	3	469	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And all unlooked-for from your Highness’ mouth.
Richard II	1	3	470	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
Richard II	1	3	471	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	As to be cast forth in the common air,
Richard II	1	3	472	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Have I deservèd at your Highness’ hands.
Richard II	1	3	473	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	The language I have learnt these forty years,
Richard II	1	3	474	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	My native English, now I must forgo;
Richard II	1	3	475	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And now my tongue’s use is to me no more
Richard II	1	3	476	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Than an unstringèd viol or a harp,
Richard II	1	3	477	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
Richard II	1	3	478	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Or, being open, put into his hands
Richard II	1	3	479	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	That knows no touch to tune the harmony.
Richard II	1	3	480	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Within my mouth you have enjailed my tongue,
Richard II	1	3	481	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips,
Richard II	1	3	482	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Richard II	1	3	483	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Is made my jailor to attend on me.
Richard II	1	3	484	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Richard II	1	3	485	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Too far in years to be a pupil now.
Richard II	1	3	486	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
Richard II	1	3	487	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
Richard II	1	3	488	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	It boots thee not to be compassionate.
Richard II	1	3	489	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	After our sentence plaining comes too late.
Richard II	1	3	490	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Then thus I turn me from my country’s light,

Richard II	1	3	511	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:

Richard II	1	3	513	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	One of our souls had wandered in the air,
Richard II	1	3	514	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh,
Richard II	1	3	515	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As now our flesh is banished from this land.
Richard II	1	3	516	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm.
Richard II	1	3	517	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Since thou hast far to go, bear not along

Richard II	1	3	521	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And I from heaven banished as from hence.
Richard II	1	3	522	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know,
Richard II	1	3	523	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.—
Richard II	1	3	524	speech	verse	Mowbray_R2	Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;

Richard II	1	3	528	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
Richard II	1	3	529	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	I see thy grievèd heart. Thy sad aspect
Richard II	1	3	530	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Hath from the number of his banished years
Richard II	1	3	531	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Plucked four away. Six frozen winters spent,

Richard II	1	3	533	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Return with welcome home from banishment.
Richard II	1	3	534	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	How long a time lies in one little word!
Richard II	1	3	535	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
Richard II	1	3	536	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	End in a word; such is the breath of kings.
Richard II	1	3	537	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	I thank my liege that in regard of me
Richard II	1	3	538	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	He shortens four years of my son’s exile.
Richard II	1	3	539	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
Richard II	1	3	540	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
Richard II	1	3	541	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Can change their moons and bring their times about,
Richard II	1	3	542	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Richard II	1	3	543	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
Richard II	1	3	544	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
Richard II	1	3	545	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And blindfold death not let me see my son.
Richard II	1	3	546	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.
Richard II	1	3	547	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But not a minute, king, that thou canst give.
Richard II	1	3	548	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
Richard II	1	3	549	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow.
Richard II	1	3	550	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
Richard II	1	3	551	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage.
Richard II	1	3	552	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Thy word is current with him for my death,
Richard II	1	3	553	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
Richard II	1	3	554	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thy son is banished upon good advice,
Richard II	1	3	555	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave.
Richard II	1	3	556	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour?
Richard II	1	3	557	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
Richard II	1	3	558	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	You urged me as a judge, but I had rather
Richard II	1	3	559	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	You would have bid me argue like a father.
Richard II	1	3	560	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
Richard II	1	3	561	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.
Richard II	1	3	562	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	A partial slander sought I to avoid,
Richard II	1	3	563	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And in the sentence my own life destroyed.
Richard II	1	3	564	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Alas, I looked when some of you should say
Richard II	1	3	565	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	I was too strict, to make mine own away.
Richard II	1	3	566	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue

Richard II	1	3	579	direction	delivery	Gaunt_R2	, to Bolingbroke
Richard II	1	3	580	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
Richard II	1	3	581	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?
Richard II	1	3	582	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I have too few to take my leave of you,
Richard II	1	3	583	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	When the tongue’s office should be prodigal
Richard II	1	3	584	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To breathe the abundant dolor of the heart.
Richard II	1	3	585	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Richard II	1	3	586	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
Richard II	1	3	587	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	What is six winters? They are quickly gone.
Richard II	1	3	588	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
Richard II	1	3	589	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Call it a travel that thou tak’st for pleasure.
Richard II	1	3	590	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Richard II	1	3	591	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Which finds it an enforcèd pilgrimage.
Richard II	1	3	592	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Richard II	1	3	593	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
Richard II	1	3	594	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The precious jewel of thy home return.
Richard II	1	3	595	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Nay, rather every tedious stride I make
Richard II	1	3	596	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Will but remember me what a deal of world
Richard II	1	3	597	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I wander from the jewels that I love.
Richard II	1	3	598	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
Richard II	1	3	599	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To foreign passages, and in the end,
Richard II	1	3	600	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
Richard II	1	3	601	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But that I was a journeyman to grief?
Richard II	1	3	602	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	All places that the eye of heaven visits
Richard II	1	3	603	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Richard II	1	3	604	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Teach thy necessity to reason thus:
Richard II	1	3	605	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	There is no virtue like necessity.
Richard II	1	3	606	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Think not the King did banish thee,
Richard II	1	3	607	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit
Richard II	1	3	608	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
Richard II	1	3	609	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honor,
Richard II	1	3	610	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And not the King exiled thee; or suppose
Richard II	1	3	611	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
Richard II	1	3	612	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And thou art flying to a fresher clime.
Richard II	1	3	613	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
Richard II	1	3	614	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com’st.
Richard II	1	3	615	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Suppose the singing birds musicians,
Richard II	1	3	616	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strewed,
Richard II	1	3	617	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
Richard II	1	3	618	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Than a delightful measure or a dance;
Richard II	1	3	619	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
Richard II	1	3	620	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
Richard II	1	3	621	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	O, who can hold a fire in his hand
Richard II	1	3	622	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Richard II	1	3	623	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
Richard II	1	3	624	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	By bare imagination of a feast?
Richard II	1	3	625	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Or wallow naked in December snow
Richard II	1	3	626	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	By thinking on fantastic summer’s heat?
Richard II	1	3	627	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	O no, the apprehension of the good
Richard II	1	3	628	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.
Richard II	1	3	629	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Fell sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle more
Richard II	1	3	630	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore.
Richard II	1	3	631	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Come, come, my son, I’ll bring thee on thy way.
Richard II	1	3	632	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
Richard II	1	3	633	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Then, England’s ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu,
Richard II	1	3	634	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	My mother and my nurse that bears me yet.
Richard II	1	3	635	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Where’er I wander, boast of this I can,

Richard II	1	4	639	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	We did observe.—Cousin Aumerle,
Richard II	1	4	640	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
Richard II	1	4	641	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
Richard II	1	4	642	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	But to the next highway, and there I left him.
Richard II	1	4	643	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
Richard II	1	4	644	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Faith, none for me, except the northeast wind,
Richard II	1	4	645	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Richard II	1	4	646	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
Richard II	1	4	647	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
Richard II	1	4	648	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	What said our cousin when you parted with him?
Richard II	1	4	649	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	“Farewell.”
Richard II	1	4	650	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	And, for my heart disdainèd that my tongue
Richard II	1	4	651	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
Richard II	1	4	652	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	To counterfeit oppression of such grief
Richard II	1	4	653	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	That words seemed buried in my sorrow’s grave.
Richard II	1	4	654	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Marry, would the word “farewell” have lengthened hours
Richard II	1	4	655	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	And added years to his short banishment,
Richard II	1	4	656	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	He should have had a volume of farewells.
Richard II	1	4	657	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	But since it would not, he had none of me.
Richard II	1	4	658	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	He is our cousin, cousin, but ’tis doubt,
Richard II	1	4	659	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	When time shall call him home from banishment,
Richard II	1	4	660	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Richard II	1	4	661	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,
Richard II	1	4	662	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Observed his courtship to the common people,
Richard II	1	4	663	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	How he did seem to dive into their hearts
Richard II	1	4	664	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	With humble and familiar courtesy,
Richard II	1	4	665	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Richard II	1	4	666	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
Richard II	1	4	667	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And patient underbearing of his fortune,
Richard II	1	4	668	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	As ’twere to banish their affects with him.
Richard II	1	4	669	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench;
Richard II	1	4	670	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
Richard II	1	4	671	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And had the tribute of his supple knee,
Richard II	1	4	672	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	With “Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends,”
Richard II	1	4	673	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	As were our England in reversion his

Richard II	2	1	709	speech	verse	York_R2	Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath,
Richard II	2	1	710	speech	verse	York_R2	For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
Richard II	2	1	711	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, but they say the tongues of dying men
Richard II	2	1	712	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Enforce attention like deep harmony.
Richard II	2	1	713	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
Richard II	2	1	714	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
Richard II	2	1	715	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	He that no more must say is listened more
Richard II	2	1	716	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Than they whom youth and ease have taught to gloze.
Richard II	2	1	717	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	More are men’s ends marked than their lives before.
Richard II	2	1	718	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The setting sun and music at the close,

Richard II	2	1	723	speech	verse	York_R2	No, it is stopped with other flattering sounds,
Richard II	2	1	724	speech	verse	York_R2	As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond;
Richard II	2	1	725	speech	verse	York_R2	Lascivious meters, to whose venom sound
Richard II	2	1	726	speech	verse	York_R2	The open ear of youth doth always listen;

Richard II	2	1	732	speech	verse	York_R2	That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Richard II	2	1	733	speech	verse	York_R2	Then all too late comes counsel to be heard
Richard II	2	1	734	speech	verse	York_R2	Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard.

Richard II	2	1	737	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
Richard II	2	1	738	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And thus expiring do foretell of him:
Richard II	2	1	739	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
Richard II	2	1	740	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Richard II	2	1	741	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
Richard II	2	1	742	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
Richard II	2	1	743	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
Richard II	2	1	744	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Richard II	2	1	745	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.

Richard II	2	1	750	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Against infection and the hand of war,
Richard II	2	1	751	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	This happy breed of men, this little world,
Richard II	2	1	752	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Richard II	2	1	753	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Which serves it in the office of a wall
Richard II	2	1	754	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Or as a moat defensive to a house,

Richard II	2	1	759	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Renownèd for their deeds as far from home
Richard II	2	1	760	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For Christian service and true chivalry
Richard II	2	1	761	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	As is the sepulcher in stubborn Jewry
Richard II	2	1	762	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Of the world’s ransom, blessèd Mary’s son,
Richard II	2	1	763	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
Richard II	2	1	764	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Dear for her reputation through the world,
Richard II	2	1	765	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Is now leased out—I die pronouncing it—
Richard II	2	1	766	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
Richard II	2	1	767	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
Richard II	2	1	768	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege

Richard II	2	1	770	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds.
Richard II	2	1	771	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	That England that was wont to conquer others
Richard II	2	1	772	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.

Richard II	2	1	782	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, how that name befits my composition!
Richard II	2	1	783	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old.
Richard II	2	1	784	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast,
Richard II	2	1	785	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
Richard II	2	1	786	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For sleeping England long time have I watched;
Richard II	2	1	787	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.
Richard II	2	1	788	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
Richard II	2	1	789	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Is my strict fast—I mean my children’s looks—
Richard II	2	1	790	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And, therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.
Richard II	2	1	791	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
Richard II	2	1	792	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Whose hollow womb inherits naught but bones.
Richard II	2	1	793	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
Richard II	2	1	794	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	No, misery makes sport to mock itself.
Richard II	2	1	795	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
Richard II	2	1	796	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
Richard II	2	1	797	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Should dying men flatter with those that live?
Richard II	2	1	798	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	No, no, men living flatter those that die.
Richard II	2	1	799	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.
Richard II	2	1	800	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.
Richard II	2	1	801	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
Richard II	2	1	802	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Now He that made me knows I see thee ill,
Richard II	2	1	803	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Ill in myself to see, and in thee, seeing ill.
Richard II	2	1	804	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land,
Richard II	2	1	805	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
Richard II	2	1	806	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And thou, too careless-patient as thou art,
Richard II	2	1	807	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Commit’st thy anointed body to the cure
Richard II	2	1	808	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Of those physicians that first wounded thee.
Richard II	2	1	809	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
Richard II	2	1	810	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Whose compass is no bigger than thy head,
Richard II	2	1	811	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And yet encagèd in so small a verge,
Richard II	2	1	812	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
Richard II	2	1	813	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye
Richard II	2	1	814	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons,
Richard II	2	1	815	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
Richard II	2	1	816	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Deposing thee before thou wert possessed,
Richard II	2	1	817	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Which art possessed now to depose thyself.
Richard II	2	1	818	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
Richard II	2	1	819	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	It were a shame to let this land by lease;
Richard II	2	1	820	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	But, for thy world enjoying but this land,
Richard II	2	1	821	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
Richard II	2	1	822	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Landlord of England art thou now, not king.
Richard II	2	1	823	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Thy state of law is bondslave to the law,
Richard II	2	1	824	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And thou—
Richard II	2	1	825	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Richard II	2	1	826	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Presuming on an ague’s privilege,
Richard II	2	1	827	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Darest with thy frozen admonition
Richard II	2	1	828	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
Richard II	2	1	829	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	With fury from his native residence.
Richard II	2	1	830	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Now, by my seat’s right royal majesty,
Richard II	2	1	831	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son,
Richard II	2	1	832	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Richard II	2	1	833	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
Richard II	2	1	834	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	O, spare me not, my brother Edward’s son,
Richard II	2	1	835	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	For that I was his father Edward’s son!
Richard II	2	1	836	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	That blood already, like the pelican,
Richard II	2	1	837	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Hast thou tapped out and drunkenly caroused.
Richard II	2	1	838	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	My brother Gloucester—plain, well-meaning soul,
Richard II	2	1	839	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Whom fair befall in heaven ’mongst happy souls—
Richard II	2	1	840	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	May be a precedent and witness good
Richard II	2	1	841	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	That thou respect’st not spilling Edward’s blood.
Richard II	2	1	842	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Join with the present sickness that I have,
Richard II	2	1	843	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	And thy unkindness be like crooked age
Richard II	2	1	844	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	To crop at once a too-long withered flower.
Richard II	2	1	845	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
Richard II	2	1	846	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	These words hereafter thy tormentors be!—
Richard II	2	1	847	speech	verse	Gaunt_R2	Convey me to my bed, then to my grave.

Richard II	2	1	852	speech	verse	York_R2	I do beseech your Majesty, impute his words
Richard II	2	1	853	speech	verse	York_R2	To wayward sickliness and age in him.
Richard II	2	1	854	speech	verse	York_R2	He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
Richard II	2	1	855	speech	verse	York_R2	As Harry, Duke of Hereford, were he here.
Richard II	2	1	856	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Right, you say true: as Hereford’s love, so his;

Richard II	2	1	861	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Nay, nothing; all is said.
Richard II	2	1	862	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
Richard II	2	1	863	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
Richard II	2	1	864	speech	verse	York_R2	Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Richard II	2	1	865	speech	verse	York_R2	Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
Richard II	2	1	866	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
Richard II	2	1	867	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
Richard II	2	1	868	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
Richard II	2	1	869	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	We must supplant those rough rugheaded kern,
Richard II	2	1	870	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Which live like venom where no venom else
Richard II	2	1	871	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	But only they have privilege to live.
Richard II	2	1	872	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And, for these great affairs do ask some charge,
Richard II	2	1	873	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Towards our assistance we do seize to us
Richard II	2	1	874	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The plate, coin, revenues, and movables
Richard II	2	1	875	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed.
Richard II	2	1	876	speech	verse	York_R2	How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
Richard II	2	1	877	speech	verse	York_R2	Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Richard II	2	1	878	speech	verse	York_R2	Not Gloucester’s death, nor Hereford’s banishment,
Richard II	2	1	879	speech	verse	York_R2	Nor Gaunt’s rebukes, nor England’s private wrongs,
Richard II	2	1	880	speech	verse	York_R2	Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
Richard II	2	1	881	speech	verse	York_R2	About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Richard II	2	1	882	speech	verse	York_R2	Have ever made me sour my patient cheek
Richard II	2	1	883	speech	verse	York_R2	Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face.
Richard II	2	1	884	speech	verse	York_R2	I am the last of noble Edward’s sons,
Richard II	2	1	885	speech	verse	York_R2	Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.
Richard II	2	1	886	speech	verse	York_R2	In war was never lion raged more fierce,
Richard II	2	1	887	speech	verse	York_R2	In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Richard II	2	1	888	speech	verse	York_R2	Than was that young and princely gentleman.
Richard II	2	1	889	speech	verse	York_R2	His face thou hast, for even so looked he,
Richard II	2	1	890	speech	verse	York_R2	Accomplished with the number of thy hours;
Richard II	2	1	891	speech	verse	York_R2	But when he frowned, it was against the French
Richard II	2	1	892	speech	verse	York_R2	And not against his friends. His noble hand
Richard II	2	1	893	speech	verse	York_R2	Did win what he did spend, and spent not that
Richard II	2	1	894	speech	verse	York_R2	Which his triumphant father’s hand had won.
Richard II	2	1	895	speech	verse	York_R2	His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
Richard II	2	1	896	speech	verse	York_R2	But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
Richard II	2	1	897	speech	verse	York_R2	O, Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
Richard II	2	1	898	speech	verse	York_R2	Or else he never would compare between.
Richard II	2	1	899	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Why, uncle, what’s the matter?
Richard II	2	1	900	speech	verse	York_R2	O, my liege,
Richard II	2	1	901	speech	verse	York_R2	Pardon me if you please. If not, I, pleased
Richard II	2	1	902	speech	verse	York_R2	Not to be pardoned, am content withal.
Richard II	2	1	903	speech	verse	York_R2	Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
Richard II	2	1	904	speech	verse	York_R2	The royalties and rights of banished Hereford?
Richard II	2	1	905	speech	verse	York_R2	Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Hereford live?
Richard II	2	1	906	speech	verse	York_R2	Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?
Richard II	2	1	907	speech	verse	York_R2	Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Richard II	2	1	908	speech	verse	York_R2	Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Richard II	2	1	909	speech	verse	York_R2	Take Hereford’s rights away, and take from time
Richard II	2	1	910	speech	verse	York_R2	His charters and his customary rights;
Richard II	2	1	911	speech	verse	York_R2	Let not tomorrow then ensue today;
Richard II	2	1	912	speech	verse	York_R2	Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
Richard II	2	1	913	speech	verse	York_R2	But by fair sequence and succession?

Richard II	2	1	958	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	The King is not himself, but basely led
Richard II	2	1	959	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	By flatterers; and what they will inform
Richard II	2	1	960	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Merely in hate ’gainst any of us all,

Richard II	2	1	963	speech	verse	Ross_R2	The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes,
Richard II	2	1	964	speech	verse	Ross_R2	And quite lost their hearts. The nobles hath he fined

Richard II	2	1	969	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Wars hath not wasted it, for warred he hath not,
Richard II	2	1	970	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But basely yielded upon compromise
Richard II	2	1	971	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows.
Richard II	2	1	972	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
Richard II	2	1	973	speech	verse	Ross_R2	The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
Richard II	2	1	974	speech	verse	Willoughby_R2	The King grown bankrupt like a broken man.

Richard II	2	1	980	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
Richard II	2	1	981	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;
Richard II	2	1	982	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
Richard II	2	1	983	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
Richard II	2	1	984	speech	verse	Ross_R2	We see the very wrack that we must suffer,
Richard II	2	1	985	speech	verse	Ross_R2	And unavoided is the danger now
Richard II	2	1	986	speech	verse	Ross_R2	For suffering so the causes of our wrack.
Richard II	2	1	987	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Not so. Even through the hollow eyes of death
Richard II	2	1	988	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	I spy life peering; but I dare not say

Richard II	2	1	992	speech	verse	Ross_R2	We three are but thyself, and speaking so
Richard II	2	1	993	speech	verse	Ross_R2	Thy words are but as thoughts. Therefore be bold.
Richard II	2	1	994	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc,
Richard II	2	1	995	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	A bay in Brittany, received intelligence
Richard II	2	1	996	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
Richard II	2	1	997	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,

Richard II	2	1	1001	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	All these well furnished by the Duke of Brittany
Richard II	2	1	1002	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
Richard II	2	1	1003	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Are making hither with all due expedience
Richard II	2	1	1004	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.
Richard II	2	1	1005	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
Richard II	2	1	1006	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	The first departing of the King for Ireland.
Richard II	2	1	1007	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
Richard II	2	1	1008	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Imp out our drooping country’s broken wing,
Richard II	2	1	1009	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown,
Richard II	2	1	1010	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Wipe off the dust that hides our scepter’s gilt,

Richard II	2	2	1019	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
Richard II	2	2	1020	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	You promised, when you parted with the King,
Richard II	2	2	1021	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	To lay aside life-harming heaviness
Richard II	2	2	1022	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	And entertain a cheerful disposition.
Richard II	2	2	1023	speech	verse	Queen_R2	To please the King I did; to please myself
Richard II	2	2	1024	speech	verse	Queen_R2	I cannot do it. Yet I know no cause
Richard II	2	2	1025	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
Richard II	2	2	1026	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
Richard II	2	2	1027	speech	verse	Queen_R2	As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks
Richard II	2	2	1028	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Some unborn sorrow ripe in Fortune’s womb
Richard II	2	2	1029	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
Richard II	2	2	1030	speech	verse	Queen_R2	With nothing trembles. At some thing it grieves
Richard II	2	2	1031	speech	verse	Queen_R2	More than with parting from my lord the King.
Richard II	2	2	1032	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
Richard II	2	2	1033	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Which shows like grief itself but is not so;
Richard II	2	2	1034	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	For sorrow’s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,
Richard II	2	2	1035	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Divides one thing entire to many objects,
Richard II	2	2	1036	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Richard II	2	2	1037	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Richard II	2	2	1038	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Distinguish form. So your sweet Majesty,
Richard II	2	2	1039	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,
Richard II	2	2	1040	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail,
Richard II	2	2	1041	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Which, looked on as it is, is naught but shadows
Richard II	2	2	1042	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
Richard II	2	2	1043	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	More than your lord’s departure weep not. More is not seen,
Richard II	2	2	1044	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,
Richard II	2	2	1045	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
Richard II	2	2	1046	speech	verse	Queen_R2	It may be so, but yet my inward soul
Richard II	2	2	1047	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,
Richard II	2	2	1048	speech	verse	Queen_R2	I cannot but be sad—so heavy sad
Richard II	2	2	1049	speech	verse	Queen_R2	As thought, on thinking on no thought I think,
Richard II	2	2	1050	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
Richard II	2	2	1051	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
Richard II	2	2	1052	speech	verse	Queen_R2	’Tis nothing less. Conceit is still derived
Richard II	2	2	1053	speech	verse	Queen_R2	From some forefather grief. Mine is not so,
Richard II	2	2	1054	speech	verse	Queen_R2	For nothing hath begot my something grief—
Richard II	2	2	1055	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Or something hath the nothing that I grieve.

Richard II	2	2	1061	speech	verse	Green_R2	I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland.
Richard II	2	2	1062	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Why hopest thou so? ’Tis better hope he is,
Richard II	2	2	1063	speech	verse	Queen_R2	For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.
Richard II	2	2	1064	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped?
Richard II	2	2	1065	speech	verse	Green_R2	That he, our hope, might have retired his power
Richard II	2	2	1066	speech	verse	Green_R2	And driven into despair an enemy’s hope,

Richard II	2	2	1071	speech	verse	Queen_R2	Now God in heaven forbid!

Richard II	2	2	1077	speech	verse	Bushy_R2	And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

Richard II	2	3	1181	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Richard II	2	3	1182	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome.
Richard II	2	3	1183	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
Richard II	2	3	1184	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
Richard II	2	3	1185	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But I bethink me what a weary way

Richard II	2	3	1187	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,

Richard II	2	3	1207	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	What was his reason? He was not so resolved
Richard II	2	3	1208	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	When last we spake together.
Richard II	2	3	1209	speech	verse	Hotspur_R2	Because your Lordship was proclaimèd traitor.

Richard II	2	3	1242	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
Richard II	2	3	1243	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	A banished traitor. All my treasury

Richard II	2	3	1276	speech	verse	York_R2	Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.
Richard II	2	3	1277	speech	verse	York_R2	I am no traitor’s uncle, and that word “grace”
Richard II	2	3	1278	speech	verse	York_R2	In an ungracious mouth is but profane.

Richard II	2	3	1283	speech	verse	York_R2	Frighting her pale-faced villages with war

Richard II	2	3	1285	speech	verse	York_R2	Com’st thou because the anointed king is hence?
Richard II	2	3	1286	speech	verse	York_R2	Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind
Richard II	2	3	1287	speech	verse	York_R2	And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Richard II	2	3	1288	speech	verse	York_R2	Were I but now lord of such hot youth
Richard II	2	3	1289	speech	verse	York_R2	As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself

Richard II	2	3	1301	speech	verse	York_R2	In braving arms against thy sovereign.
Richard II	2	3	1302	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	As I was banished, I was banished Hereford,
Richard II	2	3	1303	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
Richard II	2	3	1304	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace
Richard II	2	3	1305	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.
Richard II	2	3	1306	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	You are my father, for methinks in you
Richard II	2	3	1307	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I see old Gaunt alive. O, then, my father,
Richard II	2	3	1308	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Will you permit that I shall stand condemned
Richard II	2	3	1309	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties

Richard II	2	3	1311	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
Richard II	2	3	1312	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	If that my cousin king be king in England,
Richard II	2	3	1313	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
Richard II	2	3	1314	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin.
Richard II	2	3	1315	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Had you first died and he been thus trod down,
Richard II	2	3	1316	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
Richard II	2	3	1317	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
Richard II	2	3	1318	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I am denied to sue my livery here,
Richard II	2	3	1319	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And yet my letters patents give me leave.
Richard II	2	3	1320	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	My father’s goods are all distrained and sold,
Richard II	2	3	1321	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And these, and all, are all amiss employed.
Richard II	2	3	1322	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	What would you have me do? I am a subject,
Richard II	2	3	1323	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And I challenge law. Attorneys are denied me,

Richard II	2	3	1332	speech	verse	York_R2	My lords of England, let me tell you this:
Richard II	2	3	1333	speech	verse	York_R2	I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs
Richard II	2	3	1334	speech	verse	York_R2	And labored all I could to do him right.
Richard II	2	3	1335	speech	verse	York_R2	But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
Richard II	2	3	1336	speech	verse	York_R2	Be his own carver and cut out his way
Richard II	2	3	1337	speech	verse	York_R2	To find out right with wrong, it may not be.
Richard II	2	3	1338	speech	verse	York_R2	And you that do abet him in this kind
Richard II	2	3	1339	speech	verse	York_R2	Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
Richard II	2	3	1340	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
Richard II	2	3	1341	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But for his own, and for the right of that
Richard II	2	3	1342	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	We all have strongly sworn to give him aid.
Richard II	2	3	1343	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And let him never see joy that breaks that oath.
Richard II	2	3	1344	speech	verse	York_R2	Well, well. I see the issue of these arms.
Richard II	2	3	1345	speech	verse	York_R2	I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
Richard II	2	3	1346	speech	verse	York_R2	Because my power is weak and all ill-left.
Richard II	2	3	1347	speech	verse	York_R2	But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
Richard II	2	3	1348	speech	verse	York_R2	I would attach you all and make you stoop
Richard II	2	3	1349	speech	verse	York_R2	Unto the sovereign mercy of the King.
Richard II	2	3	1350	speech	verse	York_R2	But since I cannot, be it known unto you
Richard II	2	3	1351	speech	verse	York_R2	I do remain as neuter. So fare you well—
Richard II	2	3	1352	speech	verse	York_R2	Unless you please to enter in the castle
Richard II	2	3	1353	speech	verse	York_R2	And there repose you for this night.
Richard II	2	3	1354	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	An offer, uncle, that we will accept.

Richard II	2	3	1360	speech	verse	York_R2	It may be I will go with you; but yet I’ll pause,
Richard II	2	3	1361	speech	verse	York_R2	For I am loath to break our country’s laws.

Richard II	3	1	1411	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Have stooped my neck under your injuries

Richard II	3	2	1471	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	The means that heavens yield must be embraced

Richard II	3	2	1478	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Discomfortable cousin, know’st thou not
Richard II	3	2	1479	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
Richard II	3	2	1480	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Behind the globe that lights the lower world,
Richard II	3	2	1481	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
Richard II	3	2	1482	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	In murders and in outrage boldly here?
Richard II	3	2	1483	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	But when from under this terrestrial ball
Richard II	3	2	1484	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
Richard II	3	2	1485	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And darts his light through every guilty hole,

Richard II	3	2	1488	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves.
Richard II	3	2	1489	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	So when this thief, this traitor Bolingbroke,

Richard II	3	2	1491	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Whilst we were wand’ring with the Antipodes,

Richard II	3	2	1495	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	But self-affrighted, tremble at his sin.
Richard II	3	2	1496	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Richard II	3	2	1497	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Can wash the balm off from an anointed king.
Richard II	3	2	1498	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The breath of worldly men cannot depose
Richard II	3	2	1499	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The deputy elected by the Lord.
Richard II	3	2	1500	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed
Richard II	3	2	1501	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
Richard II	3	2	1502	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	God for His Richard hath in heavenly pay
Richard II	3	2	1503	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,

Richard II	3	2	1507	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Richard II	3	2	1508	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue
Richard II	3	2	1509	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
Richard II	3	2	1510	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Richard II	3	2	1511	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.
Richard II	3	2	1512	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
Richard II	3	2	1513	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men.
Richard II	3	2	1514	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	Today, today, unhappy day too late,
Richard II	3	2	1515	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;
Richard II	3	2	1516	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,
Richard II	3	2	1517	speech	verse	Salisbury_R2	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed, and fled.
Richard II	3	2	1518	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Comfort, my liege. Why looks your Grace so pale?
Richard II	3	2	1519	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Richard II	3	2	1520	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
Richard II	3	2	1521	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And till so much blood thither come again
Richard II	3	2	1522	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
Richard II	3	2	1523	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	All souls that will be safe, fly from my side,
Richard II	3	2	1524	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
Richard II	3	2	1525	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are.
Richard II	3	2	1526	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	I had forgot myself. Am I not king?
Richard II	3	2	1527	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Awake, thou coward majesty, thou sleepest!
Richard II	3	2	1528	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Is not the King’s name twenty thousand names?
Richard II	3	2	1529	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes
Richard II	3	2	1530	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
Richard II	3	2	1531	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	You favorites of a king. Are we not high?

Richard II	3	2	1537	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Mine ear is open and my heart prepared.
Richard II	3	2	1538	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Richard II	3	2	1539	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, ’twas my care,
Richard II	3	2	1540	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Richard II	3	2	1541	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Richard II	3	2	1542	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Greater he shall not be. If he serve God,

Richard II	3	2	1549	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	To bear the tidings of calamity.
Richard II	3	2	1550	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Like an unseasonable stormy day
Richard II	3	2	1551	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
Richard II	3	2	1552	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	As if the world were all dissolved to tears,

Richard II	3	2	1559	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;

Richard II	3	2	1561	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Of double-fatal yew against thy state.
Richard II	3	2	1562	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Yea, distaff women manage rusty bills
Richard II	3	2	1563	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Against thy seat. Both young and old rebel,

Richard II	3	2	1572	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
Richard II	3	2	1573	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	O villains, vipers, damned without redemption!

Richard II	3	2	1577	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Would they make peace? Terrible hell

Richard II	3	2	1580	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
Richard II	3	2	1581	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Again uncurse their souls. Their peace is made
Richard II	3	2	1582	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	With heads and not with hands. Those whom you curse
Richard II	3	2	1583	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound

Richard II	3	2	1588	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	No matter where. Of comfort no man speak.
Richard II	3	2	1589	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,
Richard II	3	2	1590	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
Richard II	3	2	1591	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.
Richard II	3	2	1592	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Let’s choose executors and talk of wills.
Richard II	3	2	1593	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Richard II	3	2	1594	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Save our deposèd bodies to the ground?
Richard II	3	2	1595	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke’s,
Richard II	3	2	1596	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And nothing can we call our own but death
Richard II	3	2	1597	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And that small model of the barren earth
Richard II	3	2	1598	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
Richard II	3	2	1599	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For God’s sake, let us sit upon the ground
Richard II	3	2	1600	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And tell sad stories of the death of kings—
Richard II	3	2	1601	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	How some have been deposed, some slain in war,
Richard II	3	2	1602	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,
Richard II	3	2	1603	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed,
Richard II	3	2	1604	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	All murdered. For within the hollow crown
Richard II	3	2	1605	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Richard II	3	2	1606	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,
Richard II	3	2	1607	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Richard II	3	2	1608	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
Richard II	3	2	1609	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,
Richard II	3	2	1610	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
Richard II	3	2	1611	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	As if this flesh which walls about our life
Richard II	3	2	1612	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Were brass impregnable; and humored thus,
Richard II	3	2	1613	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Comes at the last and with a little pin
Richard II	3	2	1614	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!
Richard II	3	2	1615	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
Richard II	3	2	1616	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	With solemn reverence. Throw away respect,
Richard II	3	2	1617	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
Richard II	3	2	1618	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For you have but mistook me all this while.
Richard II	3	2	1619	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	I live with bread like you, feel want,
Richard II	3	2	1620	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Taste grief, need friends. Subjected thus,
Richard II	3	2	1621	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	How can you say to me I am a king?
Richard II	3	2	1622	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	My lord, wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes,
Richard II	3	2	1623	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	But presently prevent the ways to wail.
Richard II	3	2	1624	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Richard II	3	2	1625	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
Richard II	3	2	1626	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	And so your follies fight against yourself.
Richard II	3	2	1627	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	Fear, and be slain—no worse can come to fight;
Richard II	3	2	1628	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	And fight and die is death destroying death,
Richard II	3	2	1629	speech	verse	BishopOfCarlisle_R2	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
Richard II	3	2	1630	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	My father hath a power. Inquire of him,
Richard II	3	2	1631	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	And learn to make a body of a limb.
Richard II	3	2	1632	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thou chid’st me well.—Proud Bolingbroke, I come
Richard II	3	2	1633	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	To change blows with thee for our day of doom.—
Richard II	3	2	1634	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	This ague fit of fear is overblown.
Richard II	3	2	1635	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	An easy task it is to win our own.—
Richard II	3	2	1636	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Richard II	3	2	1637	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
Richard II	3	2	1638	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Men judge by the complexion of the sky
Richard II	3	2	1639	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	The state and inclination of the day;

Richard II	3	2	1641	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
Richard II	3	2	1642	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	I play the torturer by small and small
Richard II	3	2	1643	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.
Richard II	3	2	1644	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke,
Richard II	3	2	1645	speech	verse	Scroop_R2	And all your northern castles yielded up,

Richard II	3	2	1648	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thou hast said enough.

Richard II	3	2	1653	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	By heaven, I’ll hate him everlastingly
Richard II	3	2	1654	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	That bids me be of comfort anymore.
Richard II	3	2	1655	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Go to Flint Castle. There I’ll pine away;
Richard II	3	2	1656	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.
Richard II	3	2	1657	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	That power I have, discharge, and let them go
Richard II	3	2	1658	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
Richard II	3	2	1659	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For I have none. Let no man speak again
Richard II	3	2	1660	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
Richard II	3	2	1661	speech	verse	Aumerle_R2	My liege, one word.
Richard II	3	2	1662	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	He does me double wrong

Richard II	4	1	2321	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Like to my followers in prosperity,
Richard II	4	1	2322	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thou dost beguile me. Was this face the face

Richard II	4	1	2333	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face.
Richard II	4	1	2334	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed

Richard II	4	1	2337	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	The shadow of my sorrow? Ha, let’s see.
Richard II	4	1	2338	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	’Tis very true. My grief lies all within;
Richard II	4	1	2339	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And these external manners of laments
Richard II	4	1	2340	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
Richard II	4	1	2341	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	That swells with silence in the tortured soul.
Richard II	4	1	2342	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	There lies the substance. And I thank thee, king,
Richard II	4	1	2343	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For thy great bounty, that not only giv’st
Richard II	4	1	2344	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Me cause to wail but teachest me the way

Richard II	4	1	2346	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And then be gone and trouble you no more.
Richard II	4	1	2347	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Shall I obtain it?
Richard II	4	1	2348	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Name it, fair cousin.

Richard II	4	1	2350	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	For when I was a king, my flatterers
Richard II	4	1	2351	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Were then but subjects. Being now a subject,
Richard II	4	1	2352	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	I have a king here to my flatterer.
Richard II	4	1	2353	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Being so great, I have no need to beg.

Richard II	5	2	2495	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R2	Of our two cousins coming into London.
Richard II	5	2	2496	speech	verse	York_R2	Where did I leave?
Richard II	5	2	2497	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R2	At that sad stop, my lord,
Richard II	5	2	2498	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R2	Where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops
Richard II	5	2	2499	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R2	Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.
Richard II	5	2	2500	speech	verse	York_R2	Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,

Richard II	5	2	2502	speech	verse	York_R2	Which his aspiring rider seemed to know,
Richard II	5	2	2503	speech	verse	York_R2	With slow but stately pace kept on his course,

Richard II	5	2	2510	speech	verse	York_R2	“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!”
Richard II	5	2	2511	speech	verse	York_R2	Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,

Richard II	5	2	2515	speech	verse	DuchessOfYork_R2	Alack, poor Richard! Where rode he the whilst?
Richard II	5	2	2516	speech	verse	York_R2	As in a theater the eyes of men,
Richard II	5	2	2517	speech	verse	York_R2	After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,

Richard II	5	5	2822	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And here is not a creature but myself,
Richard II	5	5	2823	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	I cannot do it. Yet I’ll hammer it out.
Richard II	5	5	2824	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,

Richard II	5	5	2830	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	As thoughts of things divine, are intermixed
Richard II	5	5	2831	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	With scruples, and do set the word itself
Richard II	5	5	2832	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Against the word, as thus: “Come, little ones,”

Richard II	5	5	2839	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
Richard II	5	5	2840	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.

Richard II	5	5	2849	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Thus play I in one person many people,
Richard II	5	5	2850	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	And none contented. Sometimes am I king.
Richard II	5	5	2851	speech	verse	RichardII_R2	Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
