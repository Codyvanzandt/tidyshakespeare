As You Like It	1	1	2	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that “keeping,” for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

As You Like It	1	1	16	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.

As You Like It	1	1	27	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.

As You Like It	1	1	44	speech	prose	Oliver_AYL	Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news at the new court?
As You Like It	1	1	45	speech	prose	Charles_AYL	There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke. Therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
As You Like It	1	1	46	speech	prose	Oliver_AYL	Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
As You Like It	1	1	47	speech	prose	Charles_AYL	O, no, for the Duke’s daughter her cousin so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.
As You Like It	1	1	48	speech	prose	Oliver_AYL	Where will the old duke live?
As You Like It	1	1	49	speech	prose	Charles_AYL	They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
As You Like It	1	1	50	speech	prose	Oliver_AYL	What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?
As You Like It	1	1	51	speech	prose	Charles_AYL	Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in. Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
As You Like It	1	1	52	speech	prose	Oliver_AYL	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to ’t, for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other. For I assure thee— and almost with tears I speak it—there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
As You Like It	1	1	53	speech	prose	Charles_AYL	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so God keep your Worship.

As You Like It	1	1	56	speech	prose	Oliver_AYL	Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him, for my soul—yet I know not why— hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.

As You Like It	1	2	59	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
As You Like It	1	2	60	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
As You Like It	1	2	61	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.
As You Like It	1	2	62	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
As You Like It	1	2	63	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
As You Like It	1	2	64	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in love?
As You Like It	1	2	65	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honor come off again.
As You Like It	1	2	66	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	What shall be our sport, then?
As You Like It	1	2	67	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
As You Like It	1	2	68	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
As You Like It	1	2	69	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favoredly.
As You Like It	1	2	70	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of nature.
As You Like It	1	2	71	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by fortune fall into the fire?

As You Like It	1	2	73	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
As You Like It	1	2	74	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.
As You Like It	1	2	75	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
As You Like It	1	2	76	direction	delivery	Celia_AYL	To Touchstone.
As You Like It	1	2	77	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	How now, wit, whither wander you?
As You Like It	1	2	78	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Mistress, you must come away to your father.
As You Like It	1	2	79	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Were you made the messenger?
As You Like It	1	2	80	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you.
As You Like It	1	2	81	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Where learned you that oath, fool?
As You Like It	1	2	82	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
As You Like It	1	2	83	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?
As You Like It	1	2	84	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
As You Like It	1	2	85	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
As You Like It	1	2	86	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	By our beards (if we had them), thou art.
As You Like It	1	2	87	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	By my knavery (if I had it), then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honor, for he never had any, or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
As You Like It	1	2	88	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?
As You Like It	1	2	89	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
As You Like It	1	2	90	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	My father’s love is enough to honor him. Enough. Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
As You Like It	1	2	91	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
As You Like It	1	2	92	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.

As You Like It	1	2	102	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Or as the destinies decrees.
As You Like It	1	2	103	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.
As You Like It	1	2	104	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Nay, if I keep not my rank—
As You Like It	1	2	105	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Thou losest thy old smell.
As You Like It	1	2	106	speech	prose	LORDS.FREDERICK.LeBeau_AYL	You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

As You Like It	1	2	108	speech	prose	LORDS.FREDERICK.LeBeau_AYL	I will tell you the beginning, and if it please your Ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.

As You Like It	1	2	114	speech	prose	LORDS.FREDERICK.LeBeau_AYL	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
As You Like It	1	2	115	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Alas!
As You Like It	1	2	116	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
As You Like It	1	2	117	speech	prose	LORDS.FREDERICK.LeBeau_AYL	Why, this that I speak of.
As You Like It	1	2	118	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
As You Like It	1	2	119	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Or I, I promise thee.
As You Like It	1	2	120	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
As You Like It	1	2	121	speech	prose	LORDS.FREDERICK.LeBeau_AYL	You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.

As You Like It	1	2	141	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
As You Like It	1	2	142	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.

But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.

As You Like It	2	1	407	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
As You Like It	2	1	408	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	And in that kind swears you do more usurp
As You Like It	2	1	409	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
As You Like It	2	1	410	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
As You Like It	2	1	411	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Did steal behind him as he lay along

As You Like It	2	1	413	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
As You Like It	2	1	414	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	To the which place a poor sequestered stag
As You Like It	2	1	415	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt
As You Like It	2	1	416	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord,
As You Like It	2	1	417	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
As You Like It	2	1	418	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
As You Like It	2	1	419	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
As You Like It	2	1	420	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Coursed one another down his innocent nose
As You Like It	2	1	421	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,
As You Like It	2	1	422	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Much markèd of the melancholy Jaques,
As You Like It	2	1	423	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,
As You Like It	2	1	424	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Augmenting it with tears.
As You Like It	2	1	425	speech	verse	DukeSenior_AYL	But what said Jaques?
As You Like It	2	1	426	speech	verse	DukeSenior_AYL	Did he not moralize this spectacle?
As You Like It	2	1	427	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	O yes, into a thousand similes.
As You Like It	2	1	428	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
As You Like It	2	1	429	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	“Poor deer,” quoth he, “thou mak’st a testament
As You Like It	2	1	430	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
As You Like It	2	1	431	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,
As You Like It	2	1	432	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
As You Like It	2	1	433	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	“’Tis right,” quoth he. “Thus misery doth part
As You Like It	2	1	434	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,
As You Like It	2	1	435	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
As You Like It	2	1	436	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,
As You Like It	2	1	437	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.
As You Like It	2	1	438	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
As You Like It	2	1	439	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”
As You Like It	2	1	440	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Thus most invectively he pierceth through

As You Like It	2	1	442	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
As You Like It	2	1	443	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,
As You Like It	2	1	444	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	To fright the animals and to kill them up
As You Like It	2	1	445	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.1_AYL	In their assigned and native dwelling place.
As You Like It	2	1	446	speech	verse	DukeSenior_AYL	And did you leave him in this contemplation?
As You Like It	2	1	447	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.2_AYL	We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
As You Like It	2	1	448	speech	verse	LORDS.SENIOR.0.2_AYL	Upon the sobbing deer.
As You Like It	2	1	449	speech	verse	DukeSenior_AYL	Show me the place.

As You Like It	2	3	501	speech	verse	Adam_AYL	To burn the lodging where you use to lie,

As You Like It	2	3	509	speech	verse	Orlando_AYL	What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,

As You Like It	2	3	525	speech	verse	Adam_AYL	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,

As You Like It	2	3	533	speech	verse	Adam_AYL	In all your business and necessities.
As You Like It	2	3	534	speech	verse	Orlando_AYL	O good old man, how well in thee appears

As You Like It	2	3	543	speech	verse	Orlando_AYL	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.

As You Like It	2	7	851	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	And one man in his time plays many parts,
As You Like It	2	7	852	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
As You Like It	2	7	853	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
As You Like It	2	7	854	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
As You Like It	2	7	855	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	And shining morning face, creeping like snail
As You Like It	2	7	856	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,

As You Like It	2	7	858	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
As You Like It	2	7	859	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
As You Like It	2	7	860	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
As You Like It	2	7	861	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Seeking the bubble reputation

As You Like It	2	7	864	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
As You Like It	2	7	865	speech	verse	Jaques_AYL	Full of wise saws and modern instances;

As You Like It	3	2	955	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
As You Like It	3	2	956	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
As You Like It	3	2	957	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
As You Like It	3	2	958	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?
As You Like It	3	2	959	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	No, truly.
As You Like It	3	2	960	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Then thou art damned.
As You Like It	3	2	961	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	Nay, I hope.
As You Like It	3	2	962	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.
As You Like It	3	2	963	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	For not being at court? Your reason.
As You Like It	3	2	964	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.
As You Like It	3	2	965	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
As You Like It	3	2	966	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
As You Like It	3	2	967	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.
As You Like It	3	2	968	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say. Come.
As You Like It	3	2	969	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	Besides, our hands are hard.
As You Like It	3	2	970	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance. Come.
As You Like It	3	2	971	speech	prose	Corin_AYL	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.
As You Like It	3	2	972	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Most shallow man. Thou worms’ meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.

As You Like It	3	2	976	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.

As You Like It	3	2	1081	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first. ’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.

These time ambles withal.

As You Like It	3	2	1156	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
As You Like It	3	2	1157	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?

There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.
As You Like It	3	2	1163	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.

As You Like It	3	2	1167	direction	modifier	Rosalind_AYL	, as Ganymede
As You Like It	3	2	1168	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather point-device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
As You Like It	3	2	1169	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
As You Like It	3	2	1170	direction	modifier	Rosalind_AYL	, as Ganymede
As You Like It	3	2	1171	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
As You Like It	3	2	1172	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.

As You Like It	3	2	1177	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
As You Like It	3	2	1178	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	Did you ever cure any so?
As You Like It	3	2	1179	direction	modifier	Rosalind_AYL	, as Ganymede
As You Like It	3	2	1180	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are, for the most part, cattle of this color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in ’t.
As You Like It	3	2	1181	speech	prose	Orlando_AYL	I would not be cured, youth.

As You Like It	3	3	1197	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
As You Like It	3	3	1198	speech	prose	Audrey_AYL	I do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
As You Like It	3	3	1199	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
As You Like It	3	3	1200	speech	prose	Audrey_AYL	Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
As You Like It	3	3	1201	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.
As You Like It	3	3	1202	speech	prose	Audrey_AYL	Would you not have me honest?
As You Like It	3	3	1203	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

As You Like It	3	3	1207	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
As You Like It	3	3	1208	speech	prose	Audrey_AYL	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
As You Like It	3	3	1209	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.

As You Like It	3	3	1212	speech	prose	Audrey_AYL	Well, the gods give us joy.
As You Like It	3	3	1213	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage. As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said “Many a man knows no end of his goods.” Right: many a man has good horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.

Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot. Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
As You Like It	3	3	1225	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.

As You Like It	3	4	1252	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.

As You Like It	3	4	1254	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
As You Like It	3	4	1255	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	You have heard him swear downright he was.
As You Like It	3	4	1256	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	“Was” is not “is.” Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father.
As You Like It	3	4	1257	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?
As You Like It	3	4	1258	speech	prose	Celia_AYL	O, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides.

As You Like It	3	5	1384	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	And yet it is not that I bear thee love;

As You Like It	3	5	1406	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him
As You Like It	3	5	1407	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
As You Like It	3	5	1408	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.
As You Like It	3	5	1409	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.
As You Like It	3	5	1410	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.

As You Like It	3	5	1419	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	I have more cause to hate him than to love him.
As You Like It	3	5	1420	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	For what had he to do to chide at me?
As You Like It	3	5	1421	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,
As You Like It	3	5	1422	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	And now I am remembered, scorned at me.
As You Like It	3	5	1423	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	I marvel why I answered not again.
As You Like It	3	5	1424	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.
As You Like It	3	5	1425	speech	verse	Phoebe_AYL	I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,

As You Like It	4	1	1478	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

As You Like It	4	1	1493	speech	prose	Rosalind_AYL	No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.

Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.

Neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.

A poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.

As You Like It	5	4	2010	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called “the retort courteous.” If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called “the quip modest.” If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is called “the reply churlish.” If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called “the reproof valiant.” If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial,” and “the lie direct.”
As You Like It	5	4	2011	speech	prose	Jaques_AYL	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
As You Like It	5	4	2012	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and so we measured swords and parted.
As You Like It	5	4	2013	speech	prose	Jaques_AYL	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
As You Like It	5	4	2014	speech	prose	Touchstone_AYL	O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, “the retort courteous”; the second, “the quip modest”; the third, “the reply churlish”; the fourth, “the reproof valiant”; the fifth, “the countercheck quarrelsome”; the sixth, “the lie with circumstance”; the seventh, “the lie direct.” All these you may avoid but the lie direct, and you may avoid that too with an “if.” I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if,” as: “If you said so, then I said so.” And they shook hands and swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker: much virtue in “if.”
