Henry VIII	1	1	1	direction	entrance	Abergavenny_H8	Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.
Henry VIII	1	1	2	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Good morrow, and well met. How have you done
Henry VIII	1	1	3	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Since last we saw in France?
Henry VIII	1	1	4	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	I thank your Grace,
Henry VIII	1	1	5	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer
Henry VIII	1	1	6	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Of what I saw there.
Henry VIII	1	1	7	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	An untimely ague
Henry VIII	1	1	8	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Stayed me a prisoner in my chamber when
Henry VIII	1	1	9	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
Henry VIII	1	1	10	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Met in the vale of Andren.
Henry VIII	1	1	11	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	’Twixt Guynes and Arde.
Henry VIII	1	1	12	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,
Henry VIII	1	1	13	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung
Henry VIII	1	1	14	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	In their embracement, as they grew together—
Henry VIII	1	1	15	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Which had they, what four throned ones could have weighed
Henry VIII	1	1	16	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Such a compounded one?
Henry VIII	1	1	17	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	All the whole time
Henry VIII	1	1	18	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I was my chamber’s prisoner.
Henry VIII	1	1	19	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Then you lost
Henry VIII	1	1	20	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The view of earthly glory. Men might say
Henry VIII	1	1	21	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Till this time pomp was single, but now married
Henry VIII	1	1	22	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	To one above itself. Each following day
Henry VIII	1	1	23	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Became the next day’s master, till the last
Henry VIII	1	1	24	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Made former wonders its. Today the French,
Henry VIII	1	1	25	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
Henry VIII	1	1	26	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Shone down the English, and tomorrow they
Henry VIII	1	1	27	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Made Britain India: every man that stood
Henry VIII	1	1	28	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Showed like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
Henry VIII	1	1	29	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	As cherubins, all gilt. The madams too,
Henry VIII	1	1	30	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
Henry VIII	1	1	31	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The pride upon them, that their very labor
Henry VIII	1	1	32	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Was to them as a painting. Now this masque
Henry VIII	1	1	33	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Was cried incomparable; and th’ ensuing night
Henry VIII	1	1	34	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
Henry VIII	1	1	35	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Equal in luster, were now best, now worst,
Henry VIII	1	1	36	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	As presence did present them: him in eye
Henry VIII	1	1	37	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Still him in praise; and being present both,
Henry VIII	1	1	38	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	’Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
Henry VIII	1	1	39	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns—
Henry VIII	1	1	40	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	For so they phrase ’em—by their heralds challenged
Henry VIII	1	1	41	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
Henry VIII	1	1	42	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Beyond thought’s compass, that former fabulous story,
Henry VIII	1	1	43	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Being now seen possible enough, got credit
Henry VIII	1	1	44	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That Bevis was believed.
Henry VIII	1	1	45	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	O, you go far.
Henry VIII	1	1	46	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	As I belong to worship, and affect
Henry VIII	1	1	47	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	In honor honesty, the tract of everything
Henry VIII	1	1	48	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Would by a good discourser lose some life
Henry VIII	1	1	49	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Which action’s self was tongue to. All was royal;
Henry VIII	1	1	50	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	To the disposing of it naught rebelled.
Henry VIII	1	1	51	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Order gave each thing view. The office did
Henry VIII	1	1	52	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Distinctly his full function.
Henry VIII	1	1	53	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Who did guide,
Henry VIII	1	1	54	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I mean who set the body and the limbs
Henry VIII	1	1	55	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Of this great sport together, as you guess?
Henry VIII	1	1	56	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	One, certes, that promises no element
Henry VIII	1	1	57	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	In such a business.
Henry VIII	1	1	58	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I pray you who, my lord?
Henry VIII	1	1	59	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	All this was ordered by the good discretion
Henry VIII	1	1	60	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
Henry VIII	1	1	61	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	The devil speed him! No man’s pie is freed
Henry VIII	1	1	62	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	From his ambitious finger. What had he
Henry VIII	1	1	63	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
Henry VIII	1	1	64	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	That such a keech can with his very bulk
Henry VIII	1	1	65	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Take up the rays o’ th’ beneficial sun
Henry VIII	1	1	66	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And keep it from the Earth.
Henry VIII	1	1	67	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Surely, sir,
Henry VIII	1	1	68	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	There’s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
Henry VIII	1	1	69	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	For, being not propped by ancestry, whose grace
Henry VIII	1	1	70	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Chalks successors their way, nor called upon
Henry VIII	1	1	71	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	For high feats done to th’ crown, neither allied
Henry VIII	1	1	72	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	To eminent assistants, but spiderlike,
Henry VIII	1	1	73	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note
Henry VIII	1	1	74	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The force of his own merit makes his way—
Henry VIII	1	1	75	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	A gift that heaven gives for him which buys
Henry VIII	1	1	76	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	A place next to the King.
Henry VIII	1	1	77	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	I cannot tell
Henry VIII	1	1	78	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	What heaven hath given him—let some graver eye
Henry VIII	1	1	79	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	Pierce into that—but I can see his pride
Henry VIII	1	1	80	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?
Henry VIII	1	1	81	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	If not from hell, the devil is a niggard,
Henry VIII	1	1	82	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	Or has given all before, and he begins
Henry VIII	1	1	83	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	A new hell in himself.
Henry VIII	1	1	84	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Why the devil,
Henry VIII	1	1	85	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Upon this French going-out, took he upon him,
Henry VIII	1	1	86	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Without the privity o’ th’ King, t’ appoint
Henry VIII	1	1	87	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
Henry VIII	1	1	88	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Of all the gentry, for the most part such
Henry VIII	1	1	89	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To whom as great a charge as little honor
Henry VIII	1	1	90	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,
Henry VIII	1	1	91	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	The honorable board of council out,
Henry VIII	1	1	92	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Must fetch him in he papers.
Henry VIII	1	1	93	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	I do know
Henry VIII	1	1	94	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
Henry VIII	1	1	95	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	By this so sickened their estates that never
Henry VIII	1	1	96	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	They shall abound as formerly.
Henry VIII	1	1	97	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	O, many
Henry VIII	1	1	98	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em
Henry VIII	1	1	99	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	For this great journey. What did this vanity
Henry VIII	1	1	100	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	But minister communication of
Henry VIII	1	1	101	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	A most poor issue?
Henry VIII	1	1	102	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Grievingly I think
Henry VIII	1	1	103	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The peace between the French and us not values
Henry VIII	1	1	104	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The cost that did conclude it.
Henry VIII	1	1	105	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Every man,
Henry VIII	1	1	106	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	After the hideous storm that followed, was
Henry VIII	1	1	107	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	A thing inspired and, not consulting, broke
Henry VIII	1	1	108	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Into a general prophecy: that this tempest,
Henry VIII	1	1	109	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
Henry VIII	1	1	110	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	The sudden breach on ’t.
Henry VIII	1	1	111	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Which is budded out,
Henry VIII	1	1	112	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	For France hath flawed the league and hath attached
Henry VIII	1	1	113	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.
Henry VIII	1	1	114	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	Is it therefore
Henry VIII	1	1	115	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	Th’ ambassador is silenced?
Henry VIII	1	1	116	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Marry, is ’t.
Henry VIII	1	1	117	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	A proper title of a peace, and purchased
Henry VIII	1	1	118	speech	verse	Abergavenny_H8	At a superfluous rate!
Henry VIII	1	1	119	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Why, all this business
Henry VIII	1	1	120	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Our reverend cardinal carried.
Henry VIII	1	1	121	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Like it your Grace,
Henry VIII	1	1	122	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The state takes notice of the private difference
Henry VIII	1	1	123	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you—
Henry VIII	1	1	124	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Henry VIII	1	1	125	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Honor and plenteous safety—that you read
Henry VIII	1	1	126	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The Cardinal’s malice and his potency
Henry VIII	1	1	127	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Together; to consider further that
Henry VIII	1	1	128	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	What his high hatred would effect wants not
Henry VIII	1	1	129	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	A minister in his power. You know his nature,
Henry VIII	1	1	130	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That he’s revengeful, and I know his sword
Henry VIII	1	1	131	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Hath a sharp edge; it’s long, and ’t may be said
Henry VIII	1	1	132	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,
Henry VIII	1	1	133	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel;
Henry VIII	1	1	134	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	You’ll find it wholesome. Lo where comes that rock
Henry VIII	1	1	135	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That I advise your shunning.

Henry VIII	1	1	143	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Is he in person ready?
Henry VIII	1	1	144	speech	verse	SECRETARIES.0.1_H8	Ay, please your Grace.
Henry VIII	1	1	145	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham
Henry VIII	1	1	146	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Shall lessen this big look.

Henry VIII	1	1	148	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	This butcher’s cur is venomed-mouthed, and I
Henry VIII	1	1	149	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
Henry VIII	1	1	150	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar’s book
Henry VIII	1	1	151	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Outworths a noble’s blood.
Henry VIII	1	1	152	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	What, are you chafed?
Henry VIII	1	1	153	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Ask God for temp’rance. That’s th’ appliance only
Henry VIII	1	1	154	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Which your disease requires.
Henry VIII	1	1	155	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I read in ’s looks
Henry VIII	1	1	156	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Matter against me, and his eye reviled
Henry VIII	1	1	157	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Me as his abject object. At this instant
Henry VIII	1	1	158	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	He bores me with some trick. He’s gone to th’ King.
Henry VIII	1	1	159	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I’ll follow and outstare him.
Henry VIII	1	1	160	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Stay, my lord,
Henry VIII	1	1	161	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And let your reason with your choler question
Henry VIII	1	1	162	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	What ’tis you go about. To climb steep hills
Henry VIII	1	1	163	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like
Henry VIII	1	1	164	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	A full hot horse who, being allowed his way,
Henry VIII	1	1	165	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
Henry VIII	1	1	166	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Can advise me like you; be to yourself
Henry VIII	1	1	167	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	As you would to your friend.
Henry VIII	1	1	168	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I’ll to the King,
Henry VIII	1	1	169	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And from a mouth of honor quite cry down
Henry VIII	1	1	170	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	This Ipswich fellow’s insolence, or proclaim
Henry VIII	1	1	171	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	There’s difference in no persons.
Henry VIII	1	1	172	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Be advised.
Henry VIII	1	1	173	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
Henry VIII	1	1	174	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That it do singe yourself. We may outrun
Henry VIII	1	1	175	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	By violent swiftness that which we run at
Henry VIII	1	1	176	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And lose by overrunning. Know you not
Henry VIII	1	1	177	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The fire that mounts the liquor till ’t run o’er
Henry VIII	1	1	178	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised.
Henry VIII	1	1	179	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	I say again there is no English soul
Henry VIII	1	1	180	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	More stronger to direct you than yourself,
Henry VIII	1	1	181	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	If with the sap of reason you would quench
Henry VIII	1	1	182	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Or but allay the fire of passion.
Henry VIII	1	1	183	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Sir,
Henry VIII	1	1	184	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I am thankful to you, and I’ll go along
Henry VIII	1	1	185	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	By your prescription. But this top-proud fellow—
Henry VIII	1	1	186	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but
Henry VIII	1	1	187	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	From sincere motions—by intelligence,
Henry VIII	1	1	188	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And proofs as clear as founts in July when
Henry VIII	1	1	189	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	We see each grain of gravel, I do know
Henry VIII	1	1	190	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To be corrupt and treasonous.
Henry VIII	1	1	191	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Say not “treasonous.”
Henry VIII	1	1	192	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To th’ King I’ll say ’t, and make my vouch as strong
Henry VIII	1	1	193	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
Henry VIII	1	1	194	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Or wolf, or both—for he is equal rav’nous
Henry VIII	1	1	195	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
Henry VIII	1	1	196	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As able to perform ’t, his mind and place
Henry VIII	1	1	197	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Infecting one another, yea reciprocally—
Henry VIII	1	1	198	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Only to show his pomp as well in France
Henry VIII	1	1	199	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As here at home, suggests the King our master
Henry VIII	1	1	200	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To this last costly treaty, th’ interview
Henry VIII	1	1	201	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass
Henry VIII	1	1	202	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Did break i’ th’ rinsing.
Henry VIII	1	1	203	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Faith, and so it did.
Henry VIII	1	1	204	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Pray give me favor, sir. This cunning cardinal
Henry VIII	1	1	205	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	The articles o’ th’ combination drew
Henry VIII	1	1	206	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As himself pleased; and they were ratified
Henry VIII	1	1	207	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As he cried “Thus let be,” to as much end
Henry VIII	1	1	208	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As give a crutch to th’ dead. But our Count Cardinal
Henry VIII	1	1	209	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Has done this, and ’tis well, for worthy Wolsey,
Henry VIII	1	1	210	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows—
Henry VIII	1	1	211	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
Henry VIII	1	1	212	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To th’ old dam treason: Charles the Emperor,
Henry VIII	1	1	213	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Under pretense to see the Queen his aunt—
Henry VIII	1	1	214	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	For ’twas indeed his color, but he came
Henry VIII	1	1	215	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	To whisper Wolsey—here makes visitation;
Henry VIII	1	1	216	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	His fears were that the interview betwixt
Henry VIII	1	1	217	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	England and France might through their amity
Henry VIII	1	1	218	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Breed him some prejudice, for from this league
Henry VIII	1	1	219	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Peeped harms that menaced him; privily
Henry VIII	1	1	220	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Deals with our cardinal and, as I trow—
Henry VIII	1	1	221	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor
Henry VIII	1	1	222	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Paid ere he promised, whereby his suit was granted
Henry VIII	1	1	223	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Ere it was asked. But when the way was made
Henry VIII	1	1	224	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And paved with gold, the Emperor thus desired
Henry VIII	1	1	225	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	That he would please to alter the King’s course
Henry VIII	1	1	226	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know—
Henry VIII	1	1	227	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	As soon he shall by me—that thus the Cardinal
Henry VIII	1	1	228	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Does buy and sell his honor as he pleases
Henry VIII	1	1	229	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And for his own advantage.
Henry VIII	1	1	230	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	I am sorry
Henry VIII	1	1	231	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	To hear this of him, and could wish he were
Henry VIII	1	1	232	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Something mistaken in ’t.
Henry VIII	1	1	233	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	No, not a syllable.
Henry VIII	1	1	234	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	I do pronounce him in that very shape
Henry VIII	1	1	235	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	He shall appear in proof.
Henry VIII	1	1	236	direction	entrance	Brandon_H8	Enter Brandon, a Sergeant-at-Arms before him, and two or three of the Guard.

Henry VIII	1	1	241	speech	verse	Sergeant_H8	Of Hertford, Stafford, and Northampton, I

Henry VIII	1	2	307	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am solicited, not by a few,
Henry VIII	1	2	308	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And those of true condition, that your subjects
Henry VIII	1	2	309	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Are in great grievance. There have been commissions
Henry VIII	1	2	310	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Sent down among ’em which hath flawed the heart
Henry VIII	1	2	311	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Of all their loyalties, wherein, although
Henry VIII	1	2	312	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches
Henry VIII	1	2	313	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Most bitterly on you as putter-on
Henry VIII	1	2	314	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Of these exactions, yet the King our master,
Henry VIII	1	2	315	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Whose honor heaven shield from soil, even he escapes not
Henry VIII	1	2	316	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Language unmannerly—yea, such which breaks
Henry VIII	1	2	317	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The sides of loyalty and almost appears
Henry VIII	1	2	318	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In loud rebellion.
Henry VIII	1	2	319	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Not “almost appears”—
Henry VIII	1	2	320	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	It doth appear. For, upon these taxations,
Henry VIII	1	2	321	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The clothiers all, not able to maintain
Henry VIII	1	2	322	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The many to them longing, have put off
Henry VIII	1	2	323	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
Henry VIII	1	2	324	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Unfit for other life, compelled by hunger
Henry VIII	1	2	325	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And lack of other means, in desperate manner
Henry VIII	1	2	326	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Daring th’ event to th’ teeth, are all in uproar,
Henry VIII	1	2	327	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And danger serves among them.
Henry VIII	1	2	328	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Taxation?
Henry VIII	1	2	329	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Wherein? And what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,
Henry VIII	1	2	330	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	You that are blamed for it alike with us,
Henry VIII	1	2	331	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Know you of this taxation?
Henry VIII	1	2	332	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Please you, sir,
Henry VIII	1	2	333	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I know but of a single part in aught
Henry VIII	1	2	334	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Pertains to th’ state, and front but in that file
Henry VIII	1	2	335	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Where others tell steps with me.
Henry VIII	1	2	336	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	No, my lord?
Henry VIII	1	2	337	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You know no more than others? But you frame
Henry VIII	1	2	338	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome
Henry VIII	1	2	339	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To those which would not know them, and yet must
Henry VIII	1	2	340	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions
Henry VIII	1	2	341	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Henry VIII	1	2	342	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Most pestilent to th’ hearing, and to bear ’em
Henry VIII	1	2	343	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The back is sacrifice to th’ load. They say
Henry VIII	1	2	344	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	They are devised by you, or else you suffer
Henry VIII	1	2	345	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Too hard an exclamation.
Henry VIII	1	2	346	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Still exaction!
Henry VIII	1	2	347	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The nature of it? In what kind, let’s know,
Henry VIII	1	2	348	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Is this exaction?
Henry VIII	1	2	349	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am much too venturous
Henry VIII	1	2	350	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In tempting of your patience, but am boldened
Henry VIII	1	2	351	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Under your promised pardon. The subjects’ grief
Henry VIII	1	2	352	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Comes through commissions which compels from each
Henry VIII	1	2	353	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
Henry VIII	1	2	354	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Without delay, and the pretense for this
Henry VIII	1	2	355	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Is named your wars in France. This makes bold mouths.
Henry VIII	1	2	356	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Henry VIII	1	2	357	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Allegiance in them. Their curses now
Henry VIII	1	2	358	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Live where their prayers did; and it’s come to pass
Henry VIII	1	2	359	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	This tractable obedience is a slave
Henry VIII	1	2	360	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To each incensèd will. I would your Highness
Henry VIII	1	2	361	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Would give it quick consideration, for
Henry VIII	1	2	362	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	There is no primer baseness.
Henry VIII	1	2	363	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	By my life,
Henry VIII	1	2	364	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	This is against our pleasure.
Henry VIII	1	2	365	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And for me,
Henry VIII	1	2	366	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I have no further gone in this than by
Henry VIII	1	2	367	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	A single voice, and that not passed me but
Henry VIII	1	2	368	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	By learnèd approbation of the judges. If I am
Henry VIII	1	2	369	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know
Henry VIII	1	2	370	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	My faculties nor person, yet will be
Henry VIII	1	2	371	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The chronicles of my doing, let me say
Henry VIII	1	2	372	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	’Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
Henry VIII	1	2	373	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That virtue must go through. We must not stint
Henry VIII	1	2	374	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Our necessary actions in the fear
Henry VIII	1	2	375	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	To cope malicious censurers, which ever,
Henry VIII	1	2	376	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow
Henry VIII	1	2	377	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That is new trimmed, but benefit no further
Henry VIII	1	2	378	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
Henry VIII	1	2	379	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
Henry VIII	1	2	380	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Not ours or not allowed; what worst, as oft,
Henry VIII	1	2	381	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
Henry VIII	1	2	382	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	For our best act. If we shall stand still
Henry VIII	1	2	383	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	In fear our motion will be mocked or carped at,
Henry VIII	1	2	384	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	We should take root here where we sit,
Henry VIII	1	2	385	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Or sit state-statues only.
Henry VIII	1	2	386	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Things done well,

Henry VIII	1	2	388	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Things done without example, in their issue
Henry VIII	1	2	389	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Are to be feared. Have you a precedent
Henry VIII	1	2	390	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Of this commission? I believe, not any.
Henry VIII	1	2	391	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	We must not rend our subjects from our laws
Henry VIII	1	2	392	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
Henry VIII	1	2	393	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	A trembling contribution! Why, we take
Henry VIII	1	2	394	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	From every tree lop, bark, and part o’ th’ timber,
Henry VIII	1	2	395	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	And though we leave it with a root, thus hacked,
Henry VIII	1	2	396	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The air will drink the sap. To every county

Henry VIII	1	2	414	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	It grieves many.

Henry VIII	1	2	437	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	First, it was usual with him—every day

Henry VIII	1	2	464	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish

Henry VIII	1	2	466	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	What was the speech among the Londoners
Henry VIII	1	2	467	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	Concerning the French journey. I replied
Henry VIII	1	2	468	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	Men fear the French would prove perfidious,
Henry VIII	1	2	469	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	To the King’s danger. Presently the Duke
Henry VIII	1	2	470	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	Said ’twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted

Henry VIII	1	2	479	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	To me should utter, with demure confidence
Henry VIII	1	2	480	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	This pausingly ensued: ‘Neither the King, nor ’s heirs—

Henry VIII	1	2	491	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Go forward.
Henry VIII	1	2	492	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	On my soul, I’ll speak but truth.
Henry VIII	1	2	493	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	I told my lord the Duke, by th’ devil’s illusions
Henry VIII	1	2	494	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	The monk might be deceived, and that ’twas dangerous

Henry VIII	1	2	496	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	It forged him some design, which, being believed,
Henry VIII	1	2	497	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	It was much like to do. He answered “Tush,
Henry VIII	1	2	498	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	It can do me no damage,” adding further
Henry VIII	1	2	499	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	That had the King in his last sickness failed,
Henry VIII	1	2	500	speech	verse	Surveyor_H8	The Cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads

Henry VIII	1	2	510	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The Duke retained him his. But on. What hence?

Henry VIII	2	1	806	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	So are a number more.
Henry VIII	2	1	807	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	But pray, how passed it?
Henry VIII	2	1	808	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	I’ll tell you in a little. The great duke
Henry VIII	2	1	809	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Came to the bar, where to his accusations
Henry VIII	2	1	810	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Henry VIII	2	1	811	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
Henry VIII	2	1	812	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	The King’s attorney on the contrary
Henry VIII	2	1	813	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
Henry VIII	2	1	814	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired
Henry VIII	2	1	815	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	To him brought viva voce to his face;
Henry VIII	2	1	816	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	At which appeared against him his surveyor,
Henry VIII	2	1	817	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,
Henry VIII	2	1	818	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Confessor to him, with that devil monk,
Henry VIII	2	1	819	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Hopkins, that made this mischief.
Henry VIII	2	1	820	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	That was he
Henry VIII	2	1	821	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	That fed him with his prophecies?
Henry VIII	2	1	822	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	The same.
Henry VIII	2	1	823	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	All these accused him strongly, which he fain
Henry VIII	2	1	824	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Would have flung from him, but indeed he could not.
Henry VIII	2	1	825	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	And so his peers upon this evidence
Henry VIII	2	1	826	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
Henry VIII	2	1	827	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	He spoke, and learnèdly, for life, but all
Henry VIII	2	1	828	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
Henry VIII	2	1	829	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	After all this, how did he bear himself?
Henry VIII	2	1	830	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	When he was brought again to th’ bar to hear
Henry VIII	2	1	831	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirred
Henry VIII	2	1	832	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	With such an agony he sweat extremely
Henry VIII	2	1	833	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty.
Henry VIII	2	1	834	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
Henry VIII	2	1	835	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	In all the rest showed a most noble patience.
Henry VIII	2	1	836	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	I do not think he fears death.
Henry VIII	2	1	837	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Sure he does not;
Henry VIII	2	1	838	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	He never was so womanish. The cause
Henry VIII	2	1	839	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	He may a little grieve at.
Henry VIII	2	1	840	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Certainly
Henry VIII	2	1	841	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	The Cardinal is the end of this.
Henry VIII	2	1	842	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	’Tis likely,
Henry VIII	2	1	843	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	By all conjectures; first, Kildare’s attainder,

Henry VIII	2	1	846	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Lest he should help his father.
Henry VIII	2	1	847	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	That trick of state
Henry VIII	2	1	848	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Was a deep envious one.
Henry VIII	2	1	849	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	At his return
Henry VIII	2	1	850	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
Henry VIII	2	1	851	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	And generally: whoever the King favors,
Henry VIII	2	1	852	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	The Card’nal instantly will find employment,

Henry VIII	2	1	912	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Let it alone. My state now will but mock me.
Henry VIII	2	1	913	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable
Henry VIII	2	1	914	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
Henry VIII	2	1	915	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
Henry VIII	2	1	916	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,
Henry VIII	2	1	917	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for ’t.
Henry VIII	2	1	918	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
Henry VIII	2	1	919	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
Henry VIII	2	1	920	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
Henry VIII	2	1	921	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,
Henry VIII	2	1	922	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And, without trial, fell. God’s peace be with him.
Henry VIII	2	1	923	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Henry the Seventh, succeeding, truly pitying
Henry VIII	2	1	924	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	My father’s loss, like a most royal prince
Henry VIII	2	1	925	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Restored me to my honors and out of ruins
Henry VIII	2	1	926	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
Henry VIII	2	1	927	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Henry the Eighth, life, honor, name, and all
Henry VIII	2	1	928	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	That made me happy at one stroke has taken
Henry VIII	2	1	929	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Forever from the world. I had my trial,
Henry VIII	2	1	930	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And must needs say a noble one, which makes me
Henry VIII	2	1	931	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	A little happier than my wretched father.
Henry VIII	2	1	932	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Henry VIII	2	1	933	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most—
Henry VIII	2	1	934	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	A most unnatural and faithless service.
Henry VIII	2	1	935	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,
Henry VIII	2	1	936	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	This from a dying man receive as certain:
Henry VIII	2	1	937	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Henry VIII	2	1	938	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
Henry VIII	2	1	939	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
Henry VIII	2	1	940	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
Henry VIII	2	1	941	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Like water from you, never found again
Henry VIII	2	1	942	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	But where they mean to sink you. All good people,
Henry VIII	2	1	943	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Pray for me. I must now forsake you. The last hour
Henry VIII	2	1	944	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Of my long weary life is come upon me.
Henry VIII	2	1	945	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Farewell. And when you would say something that is sad,
Henry VIII	2	1	946	speech	verse	Buckingham_H8	Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me.

Henry VIII	2	1	958	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	A strong faith to conceal it.
Henry VIII	2	1	959	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Let me have it.
Henry VIII	2	1	960	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	I do not talk much.
Henry VIII	2	1	961	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	I am confident;
Henry VIII	2	1	962	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear
Henry VIII	2	1	963	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	A buzzing of a separation
Henry VIII	2	1	964	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Between the King and Katherine?
Henry VIII	2	1	965	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Yes, but it held not;
Henry VIII	2	1	966	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	For when the King once heard it, out of anger
Henry VIII	2	1	967	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
Henry VIII	2	1	968	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	To stop the rumor and allay those tongues
Henry VIII	2	1	969	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	That durst disperse it.
Henry VIII	2	1	970	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	But that slander, sir,
Henry VIII	2	1	971	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Is found a truth now, for it grows again
Henry VIII	2	1	972	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain
Henry VIII	2	1	973	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,
Henry VIII	2	1	974	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Or some about him near, have, out of malice
Henry VIII	2	1	975	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	To the good queen, possessed him with a scruple
Henry VIII	2	1	976	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	That will undo her. To confirm this too,
Henry VIII	2	1	977	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,
Henry VIII	2	1	978	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	As all think, for this business.
Henry VIII	2	1	979	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	’Tis the Cardinal;
Henry VIII	2	1	980	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
Henry VIII	2	1	981	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	For not bestowing on him at his asking
Henry VIII	2	1	982	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed.
Henry VIII	2	1	983	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	I think you have hit the mark. But is ’t not cruel
Henry VIII	2	1	984	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
Henry VIII	2	1	985	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Will have his will, and she must fall.
Henry VIII	2	1	986	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	’Tis woeful.
Henry VIII	2	1	987	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	We are too open here to argue this.

Henry VIII	2	2	996	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	How is the King employed?
Henry VIII	2	2	997	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	I left him private,
Henry VIII	2	2	998	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
Henry VIII	2	2	999	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	What’s the cause?
Henry VIII	2	2	1000	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	It seems the marriage with his brother’s wife
Henry VIII	2	2	1001	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Has crept too near his conscience.
Henry VIII	2	2	1002	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	No, his conscience
Henry VIII	2	2	1003	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Has crept too near another lady.
Henry VIII	2	2	1004	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	’Tis so;
Henry VIII	2	2	1005	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	This is the Cardinal’s doing. The king-cardinal,
Henry VIII	2	2	1006	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,
Henry VIII	2	2	1007	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.
Henry VIII	2	2	1008	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Pray God he do! He’ll never know himself else.
Henry VIII	2	2	1009	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	How holily he works in all his business,
Henry VIII	2	2	1010	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And with what zeal! For, now he has cracked the league
Henry VIII	2	2	1011	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Between us and the Emperor, the Queen’s great-nephew,
Henry VIII	2	2	1012	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	He dives into the King’s soul and there scatters
Henry VIII	2	2	1013	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
Henry VIII	2	2	1014	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Fears and despairs—and all these for his marriage.
Henry VIII	2	2	1015	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And out of all these to restore the King,
Henry VIII	2	2	1016	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	He counsels a divorce, a loss of her
Henry VIII	2	2	1017	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That like a jewel has hung twenty years
Henry VIII	2	2	1018	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	About his neck, yet never lost her luster;
Henry VIII	2	2	1019	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Of her that loves him with that excellence
Henry VIII	2	2	1020	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That angels love good men with; even of her
Henry VIII	2	2	1021	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
Henry VIII	2	2	1022	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Will bless the King. And is not this course pious?
Henry VIII	2	2	1023	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Heaven keep me from such counsel! ’Tis most true:
Henry VIII	2	2	1024	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	These news are everywhere, every tongue speaks ’em,
Henry VIII	2	2	1025	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	And every true heart weeps for ’t. All that dare
Henry VIII	2	2	1026	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Look into these affairs see this main end,
Henry VIII	2	2	1027	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	The French king’s sister. Heaven will one day open
Henry VIII	2	2	1028	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	The King’s eyes, that so long have slept upon
Henry VIII	2	2	1029	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	This bold bad man.
Henry VIII	2	2	1030	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	And free us from his slavery.

Henry VIII	2	2	1032	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And heartily, for our deliverance,
Henry VIII	2	2	1033	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Or this imperious man will work us all
Henry VIII	2	2	1034	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	From princes into pages. All men’s honors

Henry VIII	2	2	1037	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	For me, my lords,
Henry VIII	2	2	1038	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	I love him not nor fear him; there’s my creed.
Henry VIII	2	2	1039	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	As I am made without him, so I’ll stand,
Henry VIII	2	2	1040	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	If the King please. His curses and his blessings
Henry VIII	2	2	1041	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Touch me alike: they’re breath I not believe in.
Henry VIII	2	2	1042	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	I knew him and I know him; so I leave him

Henry VIII	2	4	1316	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And to bestow your pity on me; for
Henry VIII	2	4	1317	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am a most poor woman and a stranger,

Henry VIII	2	4	1322	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Hath my behavior given to your displeasure
Henry VIII	2	4	1323	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That thus you should proceed to put me off

Henry VIII	2	4	1348	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A prince most prudent, of an excellent
Henry VIII	2	4	1349	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And unmatched wit and judgment. Ferdinand,
Henry VIII	2	4	1350	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My father, King of Spain, was reckoned one
Henry VIII	2	4	1351	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The wisest prince that there had reigned by many
Henry VIII	2	4	1352	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A year before. It is not to be questioned
Henry VIII	2	4	1353	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That they had gathered a wise council to them
Henry VIII	2	4	1354	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Of every realm, that did debate this business,

Henry VIII	2	4	1362	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Of singular integrity and learning,
Henry VIII	2	4	1363	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Yea, the elect o’ th’ land, who are assembled

Henry VIII	2	4	1368	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	His Grace
Henry VIII	2	4	1369	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Hath spoken well and justly. Therefore, madam,

Henry VIII	2	4	1371	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	And that without delay their arguments

Henry VIII	2	4	1374	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To you I speak.
Henry VIII	2	4	1375	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Your pleasure, madam.
Henry VIII	2	4	1376	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Sir,
Henry VIII	2	4	1377	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am about to weep; but thinking that
Henry VIII	2	4	1378	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	We are a queen, or long have dreamed so, certain
Henry VIII	2	4	1379	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
Henry VIII	2	4	1380	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I’ll turn to sparks of fire.
Henry VIII	2	4	1381	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Be patient yet.
Henry VIII	2	4	1382	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
Henry VIII	2	4	1383	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Or God will punish me. I do believe,
Henry VIII	2	4	1384	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Induced by potent circumstances, that
Henry VIII	2	4	1385	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You are mine enemy, and make my challenge
Henry VIII	2	4	1386	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You shall not be my judge; for it is you
Henry VIII	2	4	1387	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me—
Henry VIII	2	4	1388	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Which God’s dew quench! Therefore I say again,
Henry VIII	2	4	1389	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
Henry VIII	2	4	1390	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more,
Henry VIII	2	4	1391	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I hold my most malicious foe and think not
Henry VIII	2	4	1392	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	At all a friend to truth.
Henry VIII	2	4	1393	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I do profess
Henry VIII	2	4	1394	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You speak not like yourself, who ever yet
Henry VIII	2	4	1395	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Have stood to charity and displayed th’ effects
Henry VIII	2	4	1396	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Of disposition gentle and of wisdom
Henry VIII	2	4	1397	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	O’ertopping woman’s power. Madam, you do me wrong.
Henry VIII	2	4	1398	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I have no spleen against you, nor injustice
Henry VIII	2	4	1399	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	For you or any. How far I have proceeded,
Henry VIII	2	4	1400	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Or how far further shall, is warranted
Henry VIII	2	4	1401	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	By a commission from the Consistory,
Henry VIII	2	4	1402	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me
Henry VIII	2	4	1403	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That I “have blown this coal.” I do deny it.
Henry VIII	2	4	1404	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The King is present. If it be known to him
Henry VIII	2	4	1405	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
Henry VIII	2	4	1406	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And worthily, my falsehood, yea, as much
Henry VIII	2	4	1407	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	As you have done my truth. If he know
Henry VIII	2	4	1408	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That I am free of your report, he knows
Henry VIII	2	4	1409	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
Henry VIII	2	4	1410	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	It lies to cure me, and the cure is to
Henry VIII	2	4	1411	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Remove these thoughts from you, the which before
Henry VIII	2	4	1412	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech
Henry VIII	2	4	1413	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
Henry VIII	2	4	1414	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And to say so no more.
Henry VIII	2	4	1415	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My lord, my lord,
Henry VIII	2	4	1416	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am a simple woman, much too weak
Henry VIII	2	4	1417	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	T’ oppose your cunning. You’re meek and humble-mouthed;
Henry VIII	2	4	1418	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
Henry VIII	2	4	1419	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	With meekness and humility, but your heart
Henry VIII	2	4	1420	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Is crammed with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
Henry VIII	2	4	1421	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You have by fortune and his Highness’ favors
Henry VIII	2	4	1422	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Gone slightly o’er low steps, and now are mounted
Henry VIII	2	4	1423	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Where powers are your retainers, and your words,
Henry VIII	2	4	1424	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Domestics to you, serve your will as ’t please
Henry VIII	2	4	1425	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
Henry VIII	2	4	1426	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You tender more your person’s honor than
Henry VIII	2	4	1427	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Your high profession spiritual, that again
Henry VIII	2	4	1428	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I do refuse you for my judge, and here,
Henry VIII	2	4	1429	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Before you all, appeal unto the Pope
Henry VIII	2	4	1430	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To bring my whole cause ’fore his Holiness,

Henry VIII	2	4	1462	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Of all these ears—for where I am robbed and bound,
Henry VIII	2	4	1463	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	There must I be unloosed, although not there
Henry VIII	2	4	1464	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	At once and fully satisfied—whether ever I
Henry VIII	2	4	1465	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Did broach this business to your Highness, or
Henry VIII	2	4	1466	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Laid any scruple in your way which might
Henry VIII	2	4	1467	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Induce you to the question on ’t, or ever
Henry VIII	2	4	1468	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
Henry VIII	2	4	1469	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
Henry VIII	2	4	1470	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Be to the prejudice of her present state,
Henry VIII	2	4	1471	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Or touch of her good person?
Henry VIII	2	4	1472	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	My Lord Cardinal,
Henry VIII	2	4	1473	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honor,
Henry VIII	2	4	1474	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I free you from ’t. You are not to be taught
Henry VIII	2	4	1475	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	That you have many enemies that know not
Henry VIII	2	4	1476	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Why they are so but, like to village curs,
Henry VIII	2	4	1477	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Bark when their fellows do. By some of these
Henry VIII	2	4	1478	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The Queen is put in anger. You’re excused.
Henry VIII	2	4	1479	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	But will you be more justified? You ever
Henry VIII	2	4	1480	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Have wished the sleeping of this business, never desired
Henry VIII	2	4	1481	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	It to be stirred, but oft have hindered, oft,
Henry VIII	2	4	1482	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The passages made toward it. On my honor
Henry VIII	2	4	1483	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point
Henry VIII	2	4	1484	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to ’t,
Henry VIII	2	4	1485	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I will be bold with time and your attention.
Henry VIII	2	4	1486	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Then mark th’ inducement. Thus it came; give heed to ’t:
Henry VIII	2	4	1487	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	My conscience first received a tenderness,
Henry VIII	2	4	1488	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Scruple, and prick on certain speeches uttered
Henry VIII	2	4	1489	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	By th’ Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,
Henry VIII	2	4	1490	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Who had been hither sent on the debating
Henry VIII	2	4	1491	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orleans and
Henry VIII	2	4	1492	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Our daughter Mary. I’ th’ progress of this business,
Henry VIII	2	4	1493	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Ere a determinate resolution, he,
Henry VIII	2	4	1494	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I mean the Bishop, did require a respite
Henry VIII	2	4	1495	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Wherein he might the King his lord advertise
Henry VIII	2	4	1496	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Whether our daughter were legitimate,
Henry VIII	2	4	1497	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
Henry VIII	2	4	1498	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Sometime our brother’s wife. This respite shook
Henry VIII	2	4	1499	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The bosom of my conscience, entered me,
Henry VIII	2	4	1500	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble
Henry VIII	2	4	1501	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The region of my breast; which forced such way
Henry VIII	2	4	1502	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	That many mazed considerings did throng
Henry VIII	2	4	1503	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	And pressed in with this caution. First, methought
Henry VIII	2	4	1504	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had
Henry VIII	2	4	1505	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Commanded nature that my lady’s womb,
Henry VIII	2	4	1506	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	If it conceived a male child by me, should
Henry VIII	2	4	1507	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Do no more offices of life to ’t than
Henry VIII	2	4	1508	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The grave does to th’ dead, for her male issue
Henry VIII	2	4	1509	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Or died where they were made, or shortly after
Henry VIII	2	4	1510	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	This world had aired them. Hence I took a thought
Henry VIII	2	4	1511	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,
Henry VIII	2	4	1512	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Well worthy the best heir o’ th’ world, should not
Henry VIII	2	4	1513	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Be gladded in ’t by me. Then follows that
Henry VIII	2	4	1514	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I weighed the danger which my realms stood in
Henry VIII	2	4	1515	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me
Henry VIII	2	4	1516	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
Henry VIII	2	4	1517	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
Henry VIII	2	4	1518	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Toward this remedy whereupon we are
Henry VIII	2	4	1519	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Now present here together. That’s to say,
Henry VIII	2	4	1520	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I meant to rectify my conscience, which
Henry VIII	2	4	1521	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,
Henry VIII	2	4	1522	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	By all the reverend fathers of the land
Henry VIII	2	4	1523	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	And doctors learnèd. First, I began in private
Henry VIII	2	4	1524	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember
Henry VIII	2	4	1525	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	How under my oppression I did reek
Henry VIII	2	4	1526	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	When I first moved you.
Henry VIII	2	4	1527	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	Very well, my liege.
Henry VIII	2	4	1528	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I have spoke long. Be pleased yourself to say
Henry VIII	2	4	1529	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	How far you satisfied me.
Henry VIII	2	4	1530	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	So please your Highness,
Henry VIII	2	4	1531	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	The question did at first so stagger me,
Henry VIII	2	4	1532	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	Bearing a state of mighty moment in ’t
Henry VIII	2	4	1533	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	And consequence of dread, that I committed
Henry VIII	2	4	1534	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt,
Henry VIII	2	4	1535	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	And did entreat your Highness to this course
Henry VIII	2	4	1536	speech	verse	BishopOfLincoln_H8	Which you are running here.
Henry VIII	2	4	1537	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I then moved you,
Henry VIII	2	4	1538	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave
Henry VIII	2	4	1539	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	To make this present summons. Unsolicited

Henry VIII	2	4	1551	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	So please your Highness,

Henry VIII	2	4	1553	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	That we adjourn this court till further day.

Henry VIII	3	1	1605	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	There’s nothing I have done yet, o’ my conscience,
Henry VIII	3	1	1606	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Deserves a corner. Would all other women
Henry VIII	3	1	1607	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Could speak this with as free a soul as I do.
Henry VIII	3	1	1608	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My lords, I care not, so much I am happy
Henry VIII	3	1	1609	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Above a number, if my actions
Henry VIII	3	1	1610	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Were tried by ev’ry tongue, ev’ry eye saw ’em,
Henry VIII	3	1	1611	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Envy and base opinion set against ’em,
Henry VIII	3	1	1612	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I know my life so even. If your business
Henry VIII	3	1	1613	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
Henry VIII	3	1	1614	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Out with it boldly. Truth loves open dealing.

Henry VIII	3	1	1616	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	O, good my lord, no Latin!
Henry VIII	3	1	1617	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am not such a truant since my coming
Henry VIII	3	1	1618	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	As not to know the language I have lived in.
Henry VIII	3	1	1619	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious.
Henry VIII	3	1	1620	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,
Henry VIII	3	1	1621	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake.
Henry VIII	3	1	1622	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,
Henry VIII	3	1	1623	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The willing’st sin I ever yet committed
Henry VIII	3	1	1624	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	May be absolved in English.
Henry VIII	3	1	1625	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Noble lady,
Henry VIII	3	1	1626	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I am sorry my integrity should breed—
Henry VIII	3	1	1627	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And service to his Majesty and you—
Henry VIII	3	1	1628	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
Henry VIII	3	1	1629	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	We come not by the way of accusation,
Henry VIII	3	1	1630	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	To taint that honor every good tongue blesses,
Henry VIII	3	1	1631	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Nor to betray you any way to sorrow—
Henry VIII	3	1	1632	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You have too much, good lady—but to know
Henry VIII	3	1	1633	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Henry VIII	3	1	1634	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Between the King and you, and to deliver,
Henry VIII	3	1	1635	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Like free and honest men, our just opinions
Henry VIII	3	1	1636	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And comforts to your cause.
Henry VIII	3	1	1637	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Most honored madam,
Henry VIII	3	1	1638	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
Henry VIII	3	1	1639	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Zeal, and obedience he still bore your Grace,
Henry VIII	3	1	1640	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
Henry VIII	3	1	1641	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Both of his truth and him—which was too far—
Henry VIII	3	1	1642	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,

Henry VIII	3	1	1645	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To betray me.—
Henry VIII	3	1	1646	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My lords, I thank you both for your good wills.
Henry VIII	3	1	1647	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You speak like honest men; pray God you prove so.
Henry VIII	3	1	1648	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But how to make you suddenly an answer
Henry VIII	3	1	1649	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In such a point of weight, so near mine honor—
Henry VIII	3	1	1650	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	More near my life, I fear—with my weak wit,
Henry VIII	3	1	1651	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And to such men of gravity and learning,
Henry VIII	3	1	1652	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In truth I know not. I was set at work
Henry VIII	3	1	1653	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking
Henry VIII	3	1	1654	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Either for such men or such business.
Henry VIII	3	1	1655	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	For her sake that I have been—for I feel
Henry VIII	3	1	1656	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The last fit of my greatness—good your Graces,
Henry VIII	3	1	1657	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Let me have time and counsel for my cause.
Henry VIII	3	1	1658	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Alas, I am a woman friendless, hopeless.
Henry VIII	3	1	1659	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Madam, you wrong the King’s love with these fears;
Henry VIII	3	1	1660	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Your hopes and friends are infinite.
Henry VIII	3	1	1661	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In England
Henry VIII	3	1	1662	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But little for my profit. Can you think, lords,
Henry VIII	3	1	1663	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That any Englishman dare give me counsel,
Henry VIII	3	1	1664	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Or be a known friend, ’gainst his Highness’ pleasure,
Henry VIII	3	1	1665	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,
Henry VIII	3	1	1666	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And live a subject? Nay, forsooth. My friends,
Henry VIII	3	1	1667	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	They that must weigh out my afflictions,
Henry VIII	3	1	1668	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	They that my trust must grow to, live not here.
Henry VIII	3	1	1669	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
Henry VIII	3	1	1670	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In mine own country, lords.
Henry VIII	3	1	1671	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	I would your Grace
Henry VIII	3	1	1672	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Would leave your griefs and take my counsel.
Henry VIII	3	1	1673	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	How, sir?
Henry VIII	3	1	1674	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Put your main cause into the King’s protection.
Henry VIII	3	1	1675	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much
Henry VIII	3	1	1676	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Both for your honor better and your cause,
Henry VIII	3	1	1677	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	For if the trial of the law o’ertake you,
Henry VIII	3	1	1678	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	You’ll part away disgraced.
Henry VIII	3	1	1679	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	He tells you rightly.
Henry VIII	3	1	1680	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You tell me what you wish for both: my ruin.
Henry VIII	3	1	1681	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon you!
Henry VIII	3	1	1682	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
Henry VIII	3	1	1683	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That no king can corrupt.
Henry VIII	3	1	1684	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Your rage mistakes us.
Henry VIII	3	1	1685	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The more shame for you! Holy men I thought you,
Henry VIII	3	1	1686	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
Henry VIII	3	1	1687	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear you.
Henry VIII	3	1	1688	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Mend ’em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
Henry VIII	3	1	1689	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The cordial that you bring a wretched lady,
Henry VIII	3	1	1690	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A woman lost among you, laughed at, scorned?
Henry VIII	3	1	1691	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I will not wish you half my miseries;
Henry VIII	3	1	1692	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I have more charity. But say I warned you:
Henry VIII	3	1	1693	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Take heed, for heaven’s sake, take heed, lest at once
Henry VIII	3	1	1694	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The burden of my sorrows fall upon you.
Henry VIII	3	1	1695	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Madam, this is a mere distraction.
Henry VIII	3	1	1696	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You turn the good we offer into envy.
Henry VIII	3	1	1697	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You turn me into nothing! Woe upon you
Henry VIII	3	1	1698	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And all such false professors. Would you have me—
Henry VIII	3	1	1699	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	If you have any justice, any pity,
Henry VIII	3	1	1700	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	If you be anything but churchmen’s habits—
Henry VIII	3	1	1701	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Henry VIII	3	1	1702	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Alas, has banished me his bed already,
Henry VIII	3	1	1703	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	His love, too, long ago. I am old, my lords,
Henry VIII	3	1	1704	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Henry VIII	3	1	1705	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Is only my obedience. What can happen
Henry VIII	3	1	1706	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To me above this wretchedness? All your studies
Henry VIII	3	1	1707	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Make me a curse like this.
Henry VIII	3	1	1708	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Your fears are worse.
Henry VIII	3	1	1709	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Have I lived thus long—let me speak myself,
Henry VIII	3	1	1710	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Since virtue finds no friends—a wife, a true one—
Henry VIII	3	1	1711	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A woman, I dare say without vainglory,
Henry VIII	3	1	1712	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Never yet branded with suspicion—
Henry VIII	3	1	1713	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Have I with all my full affections
Henry VIII	3	1	1714	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Still met the King, loved him next heav’n, obeyed him,
Henry VIII	3	1	1715	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him,
Henry VIII	3	1	1716	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Almost forgot my prayers to content him,
Henry VIII	3	1	1717	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords.
Henry VIII	3	1	1718	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
Henry VIII	3	1	1719	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	One that ne’er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure,
Henry VIII	3	1	1720	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And to that woman, when she has done most,
Henry VIII	3	1	1721	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Yet will I add an honor: a great patience.
Henry VIII	3	1	1722	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
Henry VIII	3	1	1723	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty
Henry VIII	3	1	1724	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To give up willingly that noble title
Henry VIII	3	1	1725	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Your master wed me to. Nothing but death
Henry VIII	3	1	1726	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Shall e’er divorce my dignities.
Henry VIII	3	1	1727	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Pray hear me.
Henry VIII	3	1	1728	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Would I had never trod this English earth
Henry VIII	3	1	1729	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
Henry VIII	3	1	1730	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
Henry VIII	3	1	1731	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	What will become of me now, wretched lady?
Henry VIII	3	1	1732	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I am the most unhappy woman living.

Henry VIII	3	1	1736	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me,
Henry VIII	3	1	1737	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Almost no grave allowed me, like the lily
Henry VIII	3	1	1738	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That once was mistress of the field and flourished,
Henry VIII	3	1	1739	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I’ll hang my head and perish.
Henry VIII	3	1	1740	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	If your Grace
Henry VIII	3	1	1741	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
Henry VIII	3	1	1742	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You’d feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
Henry VIII	3	1	1743	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,
Henry VIII	3	1	1744	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The way of our profession, is against it.
Henry VIII	3	1	1745	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em.
Henry VIII	3	1	1746	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	For goodness’ sake, consider what you do,
Henry VIII	3	1	1747	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
Henry VIII	3	1	1748	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Grow from the King’s acquaintance by this carriage.
Henry VIII	3	1	1749	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
Henry VIII	3	1	1750	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	So much they love it. But to stubborn spirits
Henry VIII	3	1	1751	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	They swell and grow as terrible as storms.
Henry VIII	3	1	1752	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I know you have a gentle, noble temper,

Henry VIII	3	1	1755	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Madam, you’ll find it so. You wrong your virtues
Henry VIII	3	1	1756	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit,
Henry VIII	3	1	1757	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	As yours was put into you, ever casts
Henry VIII	3	1	1758	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves you;
Henry VIII	3	1	1759	speech	verse	Campeius_H8	Beware you lose it not. For us, if you please

Henry VIII	3	1	1763	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	If I have used myself unmannerly.
Henry VIII	3	1	1764	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You know I am a woman, lacking wit
Henry VIII	3	1	1765	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To make a seemly answer to such persons.
Henry VIII	3	1	1766	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Pray do my service to his Majesty.
Henry VIII	3	1	1767	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
Henry VIII	3	1	1768	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,

Henry VIII	3	2	1775	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal

Henry VIII	3	2	1782	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Remembrance of my father-in-law the Duke,
Henry VIII	3	2	1783	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	To be revenged on him.
Henry VIII	3	2	1784	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Which of the peers
Henry VIII	3	2	1785	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Have uncontemned gone by him, or at least
Henry VIII	3	2	1786	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Strangely neglected? When did he regard
Henry VIII	3	2	1787	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	The stamp of nobleness in any person
Henry VIII	3	2	1788	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Out of himself?
Henry VIII	3	2	1789	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	My lords, you speak your pleasures;
Henry VIII	3	2	1790	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	What he deserves of you and me I know;
Henry VIII	3	2	1791	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	What we can do to him—though now the time
Henry VIII	3	2	1792	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Gives way to us—I much fear. If you cannot
Henry VIII	3	2	1793	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Bar his access to th’ King, never attempt
Henry VIII	3	2	1794	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Anything on him, for he hath a witchcraft
Henry VIII	3	2	1795	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Over the King in ’s tongue.
Henry VIII	3	2	1796	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	O, fear him not.
Henry VIII	3	2	1797	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	His spell in that is out. The King hath found
Henry VIII	3	2	1798	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Matter against him that forever mars
Henry VIII	3	2	1799	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The honey of his language. No, he’s settled,
Henry VIII	3	2	1800	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Not to come off, in his displeasure.
Henry VIII	3	2	1801	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Sir,
Henry VIII	3	2	1802	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	I should be glad to hear such news as this
Henry VIII	3	2	1803	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Once every hour.
Henry VIII	3	2	1804	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Believe it, this is true.
Henry VIII	3	2	1805	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	In the divorce his contrary proceedings
Henry VIII	3	2	1806	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Are all unfolded, wherein he appears
Henry VIII	3	2	1807	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	As I would wish mine enemy.
Henry VIII	3	2	1808	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	How came
Henry VIII	3	2	1809	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	His practices to light?
Henry VIII	3	2	1810	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Most strangely.
Henry VIII	3	2	1811	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	O, how, how?
Henry VIII	3	2	1812	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	The Cardinal’s letters to the Pope miscarried
Henry VIII	3	2	1813	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	And came to th’ eye o’ th’ King, wherein was read
Henry VIII	3	2	1814	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness
Henry VIII	3	2	1815	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	To stay the judgment o’ th’ divorce; for if
Henry VIII	3	2	1816	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	It did take place, “I do,” quoth he, “perceive
Henry VIII	3	2	1817	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	My king is tangled in affection to
Henry VIII	3	2	1818	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	A creature of the Queen’s, Lady Anne Bullen.”
Henry VIII	3	2	1819	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Has the King this?
Henry VIII	3	2	1820	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Believe it.
Henry VIII	3	2	1821	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Will this work?
Henry VIII	3	2	1822	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	The King in this perceives him how he coasts
Henry VIII	3	2	1823	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	And hedges his own way. But in this point
Henry VIII	3	2	1824	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
Henry VIII	3	2	1825	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	After his patient’s death: the King already
Henry VIII	3	2	1826	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Hath married the fair lady.
Henry VIII	3	2	1827	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Would he had!
Henry VIII	3	2	1828	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	May you be happy in your wish, my lord,
Henry VIII	3	2	1829	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	For I profess you have it.

Henry VIII	3	2	1832	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	My amen to ’t.
Henry VIII	3	2	1833	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	All men’s.
Henry VIII	3	2	1834	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	There’s order given for her coronation.
Henry VIII	3	2	1835	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Marry, this is yet but young and may be left
Henry VIII	3	2	1836	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
Henry VIII	3	2	1837	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	She is a gallant creature and complete
Henry VIII	3	2	1838	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her
Henry VIII	3	2	1839	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Will fall some blessing to this land which shall
Henry VIII	3	2	1840	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	In it be memorized.
Henry VIII	3	2	1841	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	But will the King
Henry VIII	3	2	1842	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Digest this letter of the Cardinal’s?
Henry VIII	3	2	1843	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	The Lord forbid!
Henry VIII	3	2	1844	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Marry, amen!
Henry VIII	3	2	1845	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	No, no.
Henry VIII	3	2	1846	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	There be more wasps that buzz about his nose
Henry VIII	3	2	1847	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
Henry VIII	3	2	1848	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Is stol’n away to Rome, hath ta’en no leave,
Henry VIII	3	2	1849	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Has left the cause o’ th’ King unhandled, and
Henry VIII	3	2	1850	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Is posted as the agent of our cardinal
Henry VIII	3	2	1851	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	To second all his plot. I do assure you
Henry VIII	3	2	1852	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	The King cried “Ha!” at this.
Henry VIII	3	2	1853	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Now God incense him,
Henry VIII	3	2	1854	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	And let him cry “Ha!” louder.
Henry VIII	3	2	1855	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	But, my lord,
Henry VIII	3	2	1856	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	When returns Cranmer?
Henry VIII	3	2	1857	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	He is returned in his opinions, which
Henry VIII	3	2	1858	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Have satisfied the King for his divorce,
Henry VIII	3	2	1859	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Together with all famous colleges
Henry VIII	3	2	1860	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
Henry VIII	3	2	1861	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	His second marriage shall be published, and
Henry VIII	3	2	1862	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Her coronation. Katherine no more
Henry VIII	3	2	1863	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Shall be called queen, but princess dowager
Henry VIII	3	2	1864	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	And widow to Prince Arthur.

Henry VIII	3	2	1868	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	He has, and we shall see him

Henry VIII	3	2	1870	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	So I hear.

Henry VIII	3	2	1905	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	This candle burns not clear. ’Tis I must snuff it;

Henry VIII	3	2	1928	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Is in his brain. He bites his lip, and starts,
Henry VIII	3	2	1929	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
Henry VIII	3	2	1930	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Then lays his finger on his temple, straight
Henry VIII	3	2	1931	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Springs out into fast gait, then stops again,
Henry VIII	3	2	1932	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
Henry VIII	3	2	1933	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	His eye against the moon. In most strange postures
Henry VIII	3	2	1934	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	We have seen him set himself.
Henry VIII	3	2	1935	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	It may well be
Henry VIII	3	2	1936	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	There is a mutiny in ’s mind. This morning
Henry VIII	3	2	1937	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
Henry VIII	3	2	1938	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	As I required, and wot you what I found?
Henry VIII	3	2	1939	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	There—on my conscience, put unwittingly—
Henry VIII	3	2	1940	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing
Henry VIII	3	2	1941	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
Henry VIII	3	2	1942	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Rich stuffs and ornaments of household, which
Henry VIII	3	2	1943	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks

Henry VIII	3	2	2010	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	A loyal and obedient subject is
Henry VIII	3	2	2011	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Therein illustrated. The honor of it
Henry VIII	3	2	2012	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Does pay the act of it, as, i’ th’ contrary,
Henry VIII	3	2	2013	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	The foulness is the punishment. I presume
Henry VIII	3	2	2014	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	That, as my hand has opened bounty to you,
Henry VIII	3	2	2015	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	My heart dropped love, my power rained honor, more
Henry VIII	3	2	2016	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	On you than any, so your hand and heart,
Henry VIII	3	2	2017	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Your brain, and every function of your power
Henry VIII	3	2	2018	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Should—notwithstanding that your bond of duty
Henry VIII	3	2	2019	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	As ’twere in love’s particular—be more
Henry VIII	3	2	2020	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	To me, your friend, than any.
Henry VIII	3	2	2021	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I do profess
Henry VIII	3	2	2022	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That for your Highness’ good I ever labored
Henry VIII	3	2	2023	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	More than mine own, that am, have, and will be—
Henry VIII	3	2	2024	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Though all the world should crack their duty to you
Henry VIII	3	2	2025	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And throw it from their soul, though perils did
Henry VIII	3	2	2026	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Abound as thick as thought could make ’em, and
Henry VIII	3	2	2027	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Appear in forms more horrid—yet my duty,
Henry VIII	3	2	2028	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
Henry VIII	3	2	2029	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Should the approach of this wild river break,
Henry VIII	3	2	2030	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And stand unshaken yours.
Henry VIII	3	2	2031	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	’Tis nobly spoken.—
Henry VIII	3	2	2032	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Take notice, lords: he has a loyal breast,

Henry VIII	3	2	2051	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
Henry VIII	3	2	2052	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
Henry VIII	3	2	2053	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Made me put this main secret in the packet
Henry VIII	3	2	2054	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?

Henry VIII	3	2	2080	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I mean your malice—know, officious lords,
Henry VIII	3	2	2081	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
Henry VIII	3	2	2082	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Of what coarse metal you are molded, envy;
Henry VIII	3	2	2083	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	How eagerly you follow my disgraces,
Henry VIII	3	2	2084	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	As if it fed you, and how sleek and wanton
Henry VIII	3	2	2085	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You appear in everything may bring my ruin.
Henry VIII	3	2	2086	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
Henry VIII	3	2	2087	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You have Christian warrant for ’em, and no doubt
Henry VIII	3	2	2088	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	In time will find their fit rewards. That seal
Henry VIII	3	2	2089	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You ask with such a violence, the King,
Henry VIII	3	2	2090	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
Henry VIII	3	2	2091	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honors,
Henry VIII	3	2	2092	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	During my life; and to confirm his goodness,
Henry VIII	3	2	2093	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Tied it by letters patents. Now, who’ll take it?
Henry VIII	3	2	2094	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	The King that gave it.
Henry VIII	3	2	2095	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	It must be himself, then.
Henry VIII	3	2	2096	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
Henry VIII	3	2	2097	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Proud lord, thou liest.
Henry VIII	3	2	2098	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Henry VIII	3	2	2099	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Have burnt that tongue than said so.
Henry VIII	3	2	2100	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Thy ambition,
Henry VIII	3	2	2101	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Thou scarlet sin, robbed this bewailing land
Henry VIII	3	2	2102	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law.
Henry VIII	3	2	2103	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
Henry VIII	3	2	2104	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
Henry VIII	3	2	2105	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Weighed not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
Henry VIII	3	2	2106	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	You sent me Deputy for Ireland,
Henry VIII	3	2	2107	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Far from his succor, from the King, from all
Henry VIII	3	2	2108	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	That might have mercy on the fault thou gav’st him,
Henry VIII	3	2	2109	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
Henry VIII	3	2	2110	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Absolved him with an ax.
Henry VIII	3	2	2111	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	This, and all else
Henry VIII	3	2	2112	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
Henry VIII	3	2	2113	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I answer, is most false. The Duke by law
Henry VIII	3	2	2114	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Found his deserts. How innocent I was
Henry VIII	3	2	2115	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	From any private malice in his end,
Henry VIII	3	2	2116	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	His noble jury and foul cause can witness.—
Henry VIII	3	2	2117	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you
Henry VIII	3	2	2118	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	You have as little honesty as honor,
Henry VIII	3	2	2119	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That in the way of loyalty and truth
Henry VIII	3	2	2120	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Toward the King, my ever royal master,
Henry VIII	3	2	2121	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
Henry VIII	3	2	2122	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And all that love his follies.
Henry VIII	3	2	2123	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	By my soul,
Henry VIII	3	2	2124	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel
Henry VIII	3	2	2125	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	My sword i’ th’ life blood of thee else.—My lords,
Henry VIII	3	2	2126	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Can you endure to hear this arrogance?
Henry VIII	3	2	2127	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
Henry VIII	3	2	2128	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
Henry VIII	3	2	2129	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Farewell, nobility. Let his Grace go forward
Henry VIII	3	2	2130	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	And dare us with his cap, like larks.
Henry VIII	3	2	2131	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	All goodness
Henry VIII	3	2	2132	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Is poison to thy stomach.
Henry VIII	3	2	2133	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Yes, that goodness
Henry VIII	3	2	2134	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Of gleaning all the land’s wealth into one,
Henry VIII	3	2	2135	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Into your own hands, card’nal, by extortion;
Henry VIII	3	2	2136	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	The goodness of your intercepted packets
Henry VIII	3	2	2137	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	You writ to th’ Pope against the King. Your goodness,
Henry VIII	3	2	2138	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.—
Henry VIII	3	2	2139	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
Henry VIII	3	2	2140	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	As you respect the common good, the state
Henry VIII	3	2	2141	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Of our despised nobility, our issues,
Henry VIII	3	2	2142	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Whom, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,
Henry VIII	3	2	2143	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
Henry VIII	3	2	2144	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Collected from his life.—I’ll startle you
Henry VIII	3	2	2145	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench
Henry VIII	3	2	2146	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Lay kissing in your arms, Lord Cardinal.
Henry VIII	3	2	2147	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
Henry VIII	3	2	2148	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	But that I am bound in charity against it!
Henry VIII	3	2	2149	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Those articles, my lord, are in the King’s hand;
Henry VIII	3	2	2150	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	But thus much, they are foul ones.
Henry VIII	3	2	2151	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	So much fairer
Henry VIII	3	2	2152	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And spotless shall mine innocence arise
Henry VIII	3	2	2153	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	When the King knows my truth.
Henry VIII	3	2	2154	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	This cannot save you.
Henry VIII	3	2	2155	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	I thank my memory I yet remember
Henry VIII	3	2	2156	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Some of these articles, and out they shall.
Henry VIII	3	2	2157	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Now, if you can blush and cry “Guilty,” cardinal,
Henry VIII	3	2	2158	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	You’ll show a little honesty.
Henry VIII	3	2	2159	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Speak on, sir.
Henry VIII	3	2	2160	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I dare your worst objections. If I blush,
Henry VIII	3	2	2161	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	It is to see a nobleman want manners.
Henry VIII	3	2	2162	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	I had rather want those than my head. Have at you:
Henry VIII	3	2	2163	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	First, that without the King’s assent or knowledge,
Henry VIII	3	2	2164	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	You wrought to be a legate, by which power
Henry VIII	3	2	2165	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops.
Henry VIII	3	2	2166	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
Henry VIII	3	2	2167	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	To foreign princes, “ego et rex meus”
Henry VIII	3	2	2168	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	Was still inscribed, in which you brought the King
Henry VIII	3	2	2169	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	To be your servant.
Henry VIII	3	2	2170	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Then, that without the knowledge
Henry VIII	3	2	2171	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Either of king or council, when you went
Henry VIII	3	2	2172	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold
Henry VIII	3	2	2173	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	To carry into Flanders the great seal.
Henry VIII	3	2	2174	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Item, you sent a large commission
Henry VIII	3	2	2175	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
Henry VIII	3	2	2176	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Without the King’s will or the state’s allowance,
Henry VIII	3	2	2177	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
Henry VIII	3	2	2178	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	That out of mere ambition you have caused
Henry VIII	3	2	2179	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Your holy hat to be stamped on the King’s coin.
Henry VIII	3	2	2180	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Then, that you have sent innumerable substance—
Henry VIII	3	2	2181	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	By what means got I leave to your own conscience—
Henry VIII	3	2	2182	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
Henry VIII	3	2	2183	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	You have for dignities, to the mere undoing
Henry VIII	3	2	2184	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Of all the kingdom. Many more there are
Henry VIII	3	2	2185	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	Which, since they are of you, and odious,
Henry VIII	3	2	2186	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	I will not taint my mouth with.
Henry VIII	3	2	2187	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	O, my lord,
Henry VIII	3	2	2188	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Press not a falling man too far! ’Tis virtue.
Henry VIII	3	2	2189	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
Henry VIII	3	2	2190	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
Henry VIII	3	2	2191	speech	verse	Chamberlain_H8	So little of his great self.
Henry VIII	3	2	2192	speech	verse	Surrey_H8	I forgive him.
Henry VIII	3	2	2193	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Lord Cardinal, the King’s further pleasure is—
Henry VIII	3	2	2194	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Because all those things you have done of late
Henry VIII	3	2	2195	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	By your power legative within this kingdom
Henry VIII	3	2	2196	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Fall into th’ compass of a praemunire—
Henry VIII	3	2	2197	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	That therefore such a writ be sued against you,
Henry VIII	3	2	2198	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
Henry VIII	3	2	2199	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
Henry VIII	3	2	2200	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Out of the King’s protection. This is my charge.
Henry VIII	3	2	2201	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	And so we’ll leave you to your meditations
Henry VIII	3	2	2202	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	How to live better. For your stubborn answer
Henry VIII	3	2	2203	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	About the giving back the great seal to us,
Henry VIII	3	2	2204	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	The King shall know it and, no doubt, shall thank you.
Henry VIII	3	2	2205	speech	verse	Norfolk_H8	So, fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.
Henry VIII	3	2	2206	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	So, farewell to the little good you bear me.

Henry VIII	3	2	2208	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Farewell? A long farewell to all my greatness!
Henry VIII	3	2	2209	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	This is the state of man: today he puts forth
Henry VIII	3	2	2210	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The tender leaves of hopes; tomorrow blossoms
Henry VIII	3	2	2211	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;
Henry VIII	3	2	2212	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
Henry VIII	3	2	2213	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
Henry VIII	3	2	2214	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
Henry VIII	3	2	2215	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Henry VIII	3	2	2216	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
Henry VIII	3	2	2217	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	This many summers in a sea of glory,
Henry VIII	3	2	2218	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
Henry VIII	3	2	2219	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	At length broke under me and now has left me,
Henry VIII	3	2	2220	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Henry VIII	3	2	2221	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Of a rude stream that must forever hide me.
Henry VIII	3	2	2222	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate you.
Henry VIII	3	2	2223	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched
Henry VIII	3	2	2224	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favors!
Henry VIII	3	2	2225	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
Henry VIII	3	2	2226	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
Henry VIII	3	2	2227	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
Henry VIII	3	2	2228	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Henry VIII	3	2	2229	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Never to hope again.

Henry VIII	3	2	2231	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Why, how now, Cromwell?
Henry VIII	3	2	2232	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	I have no power to speak, sir.
Henry VIII	3	2	2233	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	What, amazed
Henry VIII	3	2	2234	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder

Henry VIII	3	2	2236	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I am fall’n indeed.
Henry VIII	3	2	2237	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	How does your Grace?
Henry VIII	3	2	2238	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Why, well.
Henry VIII	3	2	2239	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
Henry VIII	3	2	2240	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I know myself now, and I feel within me
Henry VIII	3	2	2241	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	A peace above all earthly dignities,
Henry VIII	3	2	2242	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	A still and quiet conscience. The King has cured me—
Henry VIII	3	2	2243	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I humbly thank his Grace—and from these shoulders,
Henry VIII	3	2	2244	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	These ruined pillars, out of pity, taken
Henry VIII	3	2	2245	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	A load would sink a navy: too much honor.
Henry VIII	3	2	2246	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden
Henry VIII	3	2	2247	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.
Henry VIII	3	2	2248	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
Henry VIII	3	2	2249	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,
Henry VIII	3	2	2250	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
Henry VIII	3	2	2251	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	To endure more miseries and greater far
Henry VIII	3	2	2252	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
Henry VIII	3	2	2253	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	What news abroad?
Henry VIII	3	2	2254	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	The heaviest and the worst
Henry VIII	3	2	2255	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Is your displeasure with the King.
Henry VIII	3	2	2256	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	God bless him.
Henry VIII	3	2	2257	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Henry VIII	3	2	2258	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Lord Chancellor in your place.
Henry VIII	3	2	2259	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That’s somewhat sudden.
Henry VIII	3	2	2260	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	But he’s a learnèd man. May he continue

Henry VIII	3	2	2262	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,

Henry VIII	3	2	2264	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	May have a tomb of orphans’ tears wept on him.
Henry VIII	3	2	2265	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	What more?
Henry VIII	3	2	2266	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	That Cranmer is returned with welcome,
Henry VIII	3	2	2267	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
Henry VIII	3	2	2268	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That’s news indeed.
Henry VIII	3	2	2269	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Last, that the Lady Anne,
Henry VIII	3	2	2270	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,
Henry VIII	3	2	2271	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	This day was viewed in open as his queen,
Henry VIII	3	2	2272	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Going to chapel, and the voice is now
Henry VIII	3	2	2273	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Only about her coronation.
Henry VIII	3	2	2274	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	There was the weight that pulled me down. O Cromwell,
Henry VIII	3	2	2275	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	The King has gone beyond me. All my glories
Henry VIII	3	2	2276	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	In that one woman I have lost forever.
Henry VIII	3	2	2277	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,
Henry VIII	3	2	2278	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Henry VIII	3	2	2279	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell.
Henry VIII	3	2	2280	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I am a poor fall’n man, unworthy now
Henry VIII	3	2	2281	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	To be thy lord and master. Seek the King;
Henry VIII	3	2	2282	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
Henry VIII	3	2	2283	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	What and how true thou art. He will advance thee;
Henry VIII	3	2	2284	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Some little memory of me will stir him—
Henry VIII	3	2	2285	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	I know his noble nature—not to let
Henry VIII	3	2	2286	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,
Henry VIII	3	2	2287	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Neglect him not. Make use now, and provide
Henry VIII	3	2	2288	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	For thine own future safety.

Henry VIII	3	2	2292	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	So good, so noble, and so true a master?
Henry VIII	3	2	2293	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
Henry VIII	3	2	2294	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
Henry VIII	3	2	2295	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	The King shall have my service, but my prayers

Henry VIII	3	2	2300	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Henry VIII	3	2	2301	speech	verse	Wolsey_H8	Let’s dry our eyes. And thus far hear me, Cromwell,

Henry VIII	4	1	2442	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces
Henry VIII	4	1	2443	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Came to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike
Henry VIII	4	1	2444	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly,
Henry VIII	4	1	2445	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Then rose again and bowed her to the people.
Henry VIII	4	1	2446	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
Henry VIII	4	1	2447	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	She had all the royal makings of a queen—
Henry VIII	4	1	2448	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	As, holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,
Henry VIII	4	1	2449	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems—
Henry VIII	4	1	2450	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Laid nobly on her; which performed, the choir,
Henry VIII	4	1	2451	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
Henry VIII	4	1	2452	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Together sung Te Deum. So she parted,
Henry VIII	4	1	2453	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	And with the same full state paced back again
Henry VIII	4	1	2454	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	To York Place, where the feast is held.
Henry VIII	4	1	2455	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	Sir,
Henry VIII	4	1	2456	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	You must no more call it “York Place”; that’s past,
Henry VIII	4	1	2457	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost.
Henry VIII	4	1	2458	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.1_H8	’Tis now the King’s and called “Whitehall.”
Henry VIII	4	1	2459	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	I know it,
Henry VIII	4	1	2460	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	But ’tis so lately altered that the old name
Henry VIII	4	1	2461	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Is fresh about me.
Henry VIII	4	1	2462	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	What two reverend bishops
Henry VIII	4	1	2463	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Were those that went on each side of the Queen?
Henry VIII	4	1	2464	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Stokeley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,
Henry VIII	4	1	2465	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Newly preferred from the King’s secretary,
Henry VIII	4	1	2466	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	The other London.
Henry VIII	4	1	2467	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	He of Winchester
Henry VIII	4	1	2468	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,
Henry VIII	4	1	2469	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	The virtuous Cranmer.
Henry VIII	4	1	2470	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	All the land knows that.
Henry VIII	4	1	2471	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,
Henry VIII	4	1	2472	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.
Henry VIII	4	1	2473	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	Who may that be, I pray you?
Henry VIII	4	1	2474	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Thomas Cromwell,
Henry VIII	4	1	2475	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly
Henry VIII	4	1	2476	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	A worthy friend. The King has made him
Henry VIII	4	1	2477	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Master o’ th’ Jewel House,
Henry VIII	4	1	2478	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	And one already of the Privy Council.
Henry VIII	4	1	2479	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.2_H8	He will deserve more.
Henry VIII	4	1	2480	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Yes, without all doubt.
Henry VIII	4	1	2481	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Come, gentlemen, you shall go my way,
Henry VIII	4	1	2482	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	Which is to th’ court, and there you shall be my guests,

Henry VIII	4	1	2484	speech	verse	GENTLEMEN.3_H8	I’ll tell you more.

Henry VIII	4	2	2489	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	O Griffith, sick to death.
Henry VIII	4	2	2490	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My legs like loaden branches bow to th’ earth,
Henry VIII	4	2	2491	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.
Henry VIII	4	2	2492	direction	business	Katherine_H8	She sits.
Henry VIII	4	2	2493	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	So. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
Henry VIII	4	2	2494	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,
Henry VIII	4	2	2495	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That the great child of honor, Cardinal Wolsey,
Henry VIII	4	2	2496	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Was dead?
Henry VIII	4	2	2497	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Yes, madam, but I think your Grace,
Henry VIII	4	2	2498	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to ’t.
Henry VIII	4	2	2499	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.
Henry VIII	4	2	2500	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	If well, he stepped before me happily
Henry VIII	4	2	2501	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	For my example.
Henry VIII	4	2	2502	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Well, the voice goes, madam;
Henry VIII	4	2	2503	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Henry VIII	4	2	2504	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Arrested him at York and brought him forward,
Henry VIII	4	2	2505	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
Henry VIII	4	2	2506	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
Henry VIII	4	2	2507	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	He could not sit his mule.
Henry VIII	4	2	2508	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Alas, poor man!
Henry VIII	4	2	2509	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
Henry VIII	4	2	2510	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot
Henry VIII	4	2	2511	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	With all his convent honorably received him;
Henry VIII	4	2	2512	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	To whom he gave these words: “O Father Abbot,
Henry VIII	4	2	2513	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Henry VIII	4	2	2514	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Is come to lay his weary bones among you.
Henry VIII	4	2	2515	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Give him a little earth, for charity.”
Henry VIII	4	2	2516	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	So went to bed, where eagerly his sickness
Henry VIII	4	2	2517	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Pursued him still; and three nights after this,
Henry VIII	4	2	2518	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	About the hour of eight, which he himself
Henry VIII	4	2	2519	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
Henry VIII	4	2	2520	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
Henry VIII	4	2	2521	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	He gave his honors to the world again,
Henry VIII	4	2	2522	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	His blessèd part to heaven, and slept in peace.
Henry VIII	4	2	2523	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	So may he rest. His faults lie gently on him!
Henry VIII	4	2	2524	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
Henry VIII	4	2	2525	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And yet with charity. He was a man
Henry VIII	4	2	2526	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
Henry VIII	4	2	2527	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Himself with princes; one that by suggestion
Henry VIII	4	2	2528	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play.
Henry VIII	4	2	2529	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	His own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence
Henry VIII	4	2	2530	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	He would say untruths, and be ever double
Henry VIII	4	2	2531	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Both in his words and meaning. He was never,
Henry VIII	4	2	2532	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.
Henry VIII	4	2	2533	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	His promises were, as he then was, mighty,
Henry VIII	4	2	2534	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But his performance, as he is now, nothing.
Henry VIII	4	2	2535	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Of his own body he was ill, and gave
Henry VIII	4	2	2536	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The clergy ill example.
Henry VIII	4	2	2537	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Noble madam,
Henry VIII	4	2	2538	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Men’s evil manners live in brass; their virtues
Henry VIII	4	2	2539	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	We write in water. May it please your Highness
Henry VIII	4	2	2540	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	To hear me speak his good now?
Henry VIII	4	2	2541	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Yes, good Griffith;
Henry VIII	4	2	2542	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I were malicious else.
Henry VIII	4	2	2543	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	This cardinal,
Henry VIII	4	2	2544	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
Henry VIII	4	2	2545	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Was fashioned to much honor. From his cradle
Henry VIII	4	2	2546	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one:
Henry VIII	4	2	2547	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;
Henry VIII	4	2	2548	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,
Henry VIII	4	2	2549	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	But, to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.
Henry VIII	4	2	2550	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
Henry VIII	4	2	2551	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
Henry VIII	4	2	2552	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	He was most princely. Ever witness for him
Henry VIII	4	2	2553	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Those twins of learning that he raised in you,
Henry VIII	4	2	2554	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Ipswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him,
Henry VIII	4	2	2555	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
Henry VIII	4	2	2556	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,
Henry VIII	4	2	2557	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	So excellent in art, and still so rising,
Henry VIII	4	2	2558	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
Henry VIII	4	2	2559	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	His overthrow heaped happiness upon him,
Henry VIII	4	2	2560	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
Henry VIII	4	2	2561	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	And found the blessedness of being little.
Henry VIII	4	2	2562	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	And, to add greater honors to his age
Henry VIII	4	2	2563	speech	verse	Griffith_H8	Than man could give him, he died fearing God.
Henry VIII	4	2	2564	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	After my death I wish no other herald,
Henry VIII	4	2	2565	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	No other speaker of my living actions,
Henry VIII	4	2	2566	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To keep mine honor from corruption
Henry VIII	4	2	2567	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Henry VIII	4	2	2568	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
Henry VIII	4	2	2569	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	With thy religious truth and modesty,

Henry VIII	4	2	2665	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Upon my wretched women, that so long
Henry VIII	4	2	2666	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Have followed both my fortunes faithfully,
Henry VIII	4	2	2667	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Of which there is not one, I dare avow—
Henry VIII	4	2	2668	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And now I should not lie—but will deserve,
Henry VIII	4	2	2669	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
Henry VIII	4	2	2670	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	For honesty and decent carriage,
Henry VIII	4	2	2671	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A right good husband. Let him be a noble;
Henry VIII	4	2	2672	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And sure those men are happy that shall have ’em.
Henry VIII	4	2	2673	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	The last is for my men—they are the poorest,
Henry VIII	4	2	2674	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	But poverty could never draw ’em from me—
Henry VIII	4	2	2675	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	That they may have their wages duly paid ’em,
Henry VIII	4	2	2676	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And something over to remember me by.
Henry VIII	4	2	2677	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
Henry VIII	4	2	2678	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	And able means, we had not parted thus.
Henry VIII	4	2	2679	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	These are the whole contents. And, good my lord,
Henry VIII	4	2	2680	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	By that you love the dearest in this world,
Henry VIII	4	2	2681	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
Henry VIII	4	2	2682	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Stand these poor people’s friend, and urge the King
Henry VIII	4	2	2683	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	To do me this last right.
Henry VIII	4	2	2684	speech	verse	Capuchius_H8	By heaven, I will,
Henry VIII	4	2	2685	speech	verse	Capuchius_H8	Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
Henry VIII	4	2	2686	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
Henry VIII	4	2	2687	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	In all humility unto his Highness.
Henry VIII	4	2	2688	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Say his long trouble now is passing
Henry VIII	4	2	2689	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Out of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him,
Henry VIII	4	2	2690	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
Henry VIII	4	2	2691	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	My lord.—Griffith, farewell.—Nay, Patience,
Henry VIII	4	2	2692	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	You must not leave me yet. I must to bed;
Henry VIII	4	2	2693	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
Henry VIII	4	2	2694	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Let me be used with honor. Strew me over
Henry VIII	4	2	2695	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
Henry VIII	4	2	2696	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,
Henry VIII	4	2	2697	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	Then lay me forth. Although unqueened, yet like
Henry VIII	4	2	2698	speech	verse	Katherine_H8	A queen and daughter to a king inter me.

Henry VIII	5	1	2704	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	These should be hours for necessities,

Henry VIII	5	1	2708	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Whither so late?
Henry VIII	5	1	2709	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Came you from the King, my lord?
Henry VIII	5	1	2710	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero
Henry VIII	5	1	2711	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	With the Duke of Suffolk.
Henry VIII	5	1	2712	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	I must to him too,

Henry VIII	5	1	2714	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter?
Henry VIII	5	1	2715	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	It seems you are in haste. An if there be
Henry VIII	5	1	2716	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	No great offense belongs to ’t, give your friend
Henry VIII	5	1	2717	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk,
Henry VIII	5	1	2718	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	As they say spirits do, at midnight have
Henry VIII	5	1	2719	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	In them a wilder nature than the business
Henry VIII	5	1	2720	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	That seeks dispatch by day.
Henry VIII	5	1	2721	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	My lord, I love you,
Henry VIII	5	1	2722	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	And durst commend a secret to your ear
Henry VIII	5	1	2723	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labor—
Henry VIII	5	1	2724	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	They say in great extremity—and feared
Henry VIII	5	1	2725	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	She’ll with the labor end.
Henry VIII	5	1	2726	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	The fruit she goes with
Henry VIII	5	1	2727	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	I pray for heartily, that it may find
Henry VIII	5	1	2728	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Good time and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
Henry VIII	5	1	2729	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	I wish it grubbed up now.
Henry VIII	5	1	2730	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Methinks I could
Henry VIII	5	1	2731	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says
Henry VIII	5	1	2732	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	She’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does
Henry VIII	5	1	2733	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Deserve our better wishes.
Henry VIII	5	1	2734	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	But, sir, sir,
Henry VIII	5	1	2735	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Hear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman
Henry VIII	5	1	2736	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Of mine own way. I know you wise, religious;
Henry VIII	5	1	2737	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	And let me tell you, it will ne’er be well,

Henry VIII	5	1	2741	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Now, sir, you speak of two
Henry VIII	5	1	2742	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	The most remarked i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell,
Henry VIII	5	1	2743	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Besides that of the Jewel House, is made Master
Henry VIII	5	1	2744	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	O’ th’ Rolls and the King’s secretary; further, sir,
Henry VIII	5	1	2745	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments,
Henry VIII	5	1	2746	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	With which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop
Henry VIII	5	1	2747	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Is the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak
Henry VIII	5	1	2748	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	One syllable against him?
Henry VIII	5	1	2749	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,
Henry VIII	5	1	2750	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	There are that dare, and I myself have ventured
Henry VIII	5	1	2751	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	To speak my mind of him. And indeed this day,
Henry VIII	5	1	2752	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Sir—I may tell it you, I think—I have
Henry VIII	5	1	2753	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Incensed the lords o’ th’ Council that he is—
Henry VIII	5	1	2754	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	For so I know he is, they know he is—
Henry VIII	5	1	2755	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	A most arch heretic, a pestilence
Henry VIII	5	1	2756	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	That does infect the land; with which they, moved,
Henry VIII	5	1	2757	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Have broken with the King, who hath so far
Henry VIII	5	1	2758	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace
Henry VIII	5	1	2759	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
Henry VIII	5	1	2760	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded

Henry VIII	5	1	2763	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	And we must root him out. From your affairs
Henry VIII	5	1	2764	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	I hinder you too long. Goodnight, Sir Thomas.

Henry VIII	5	1	2770	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Sir, I did never win of you before.
Henry VIII	5	1	2771	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	But little, Charles,
Henry VIII	5	1	2772	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Nor shall not when my fancy’s on my play.—
Henry VIII	5	1	2773	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?
Henry VIII	5	1	2774	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	I could not personally deliver to her
Henry VIII	5	1	2775	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	What you commanded me, but by her woman
Henry VIII	5	1	2776	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	I sent your message, who returned her thanks
Henry VIII	5	1	2777	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	In the great’st humbleness, and desired your Highness
Henry VIII	5	1	2778	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	Most heartily to pray for her.
Henry VIII	5	1	2779	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	What sayst thou, ha?

Henry VIII	5	1	2781	speech	verse	Lovell_H8	So said her woman, and that her suff’rance made

Henry VIII	5	2	3007	speech	verse	Chancellor_H8	And want of wisdom you, that best should teach us,

Henry VIII	5	2	3014	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	Which reformation must be sudden too,

Henry VIII	5	2	3027	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Both of my life and office, I have labored,

Henry VIII	5	2	3029	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And the strong course of my authority
Henry VIII	5	2	3030	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Might go one way and safely; and the end
Henry VIII	5	2	3031	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Was ever to do well. Nor is there living—
Henry VIII	5	2	3032	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	I speak it with a single heart, my lords—
Henry VIII	5	2	3033	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	A man that more detests, more stirs against,

Henry VIII	5	2	3043	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	Nay, my lord,
Henry VIII	5	2	3044	speech	verse	Suffolk_H8	That cannot be. You are a councillor,

Henry VIII	5	2	3061	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Lay all the weight you can upon my patience,
Henry VIII	5	2	3062	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	I make as little doubt as you do conscience
Henry VIII	5	2	3063	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
Henry VIII	5	2	3064	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	But reverence to your calling makes me modest.
Henry VIII	5	2	3065	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	My lord, my lord, you are a sectary.
Henry VIII	5	2	3066	speech	verse	Gardiner_H8	That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,

Henry VIII	5	2	3070	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	However faulty, yet should find respect
Henry VIII	5	2	3071	speech	verse	Cromwell_H8	For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty

There is a fellow somewhat near the door—he should be a brazier by his face, for, o’ my conscience, twenty of the dog days now reign in ’s nose. All that stand about him are under the line; they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged against me. He stands there like a mortar-piece, to blow us. There was a haberdasher’s wife of small wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once and hit that woman, who cried out “Clubs!” when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place. At length they came to th’ broomstaff to me; I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind ’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pibbles that I was fain to draw mine honor in and let ’em win the work. The devil was amongst ’em, I think, surely.

Henry VIII	5	4	3288	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Amen.
Henry VIII	5	4	3289	direction	delivery	HenryVIII_H8	, to the two godmothers
Henry VIII	5	4	3290	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	My noble gossips, you’ve been too prodigal.
Henry VIII	5	4	3291	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I thank you heartily; so shall this lady
Henry VIII	5	4	3292	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	When she has so much English.
Henry VIII	5	4	3293	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Let me speak, sir,
Henry VIII	5	4	3294	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
Henry VIII	5	4	3295	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Let none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth.
Henry VIII	5	4	3296	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	This royal infant—heaven still move about her!—
Henry VIII	5	4	3297	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Though in her cradle, yet now promises
Henry VIII	5	4	3298	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
Henry VIII	5	4	3299	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be—
Henry VIII	5	4	3300	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	But few now living can behold that goodness—
Henry VIII	5	4	3301	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	A pattern to all princes living with her
Henry VIII	5	4	3302	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And all that shall succeed. Saba was never
Henry VIII	5	4	3303	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue

Henry VIII	5	4	3307	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her;
Henry VIII	5	4	3308	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.
Henry VIII	5	4	3309	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	She shall be loved and feared. Her own shall bless her;
Henry VIII	5	4	3310	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn
Henry VIII	5	4	3311	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her.
Henry VIII	5	4	3312	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	In her days every man shall eat in safety
Henry VIII	5	4	3313	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Under his own vine what he plants and sing
Henry VIII	5	4	3314	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors.
Henry VIII	5	4	3315	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	God shall be truly known, and those about her
Henry VIII	5	4	3316	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	From her shall read the perfect ways of honor
Henry VIII	5	4	3317	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
Henry VIII	5	4	3318	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but, as when
Henry VIII	5	4	3319	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Henry VIII	5	4	3320	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Her ashes new create another heir
Henry VIII	5	4	3321	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	As great in admiration as herself,
Henry VIII	5	4	3322	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
Henry VIII	5	4	3323	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Henry VIII	5	4	3324	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Who from the sacred ashes of her honor
Henry VIII	5	4	3325	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was
Henry VIII	5	4	3326	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And so stand fixed. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
Henry VIII	5	4	3327	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	That were the servants to this chosen infant,
Henry VIII	5	4	3328	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him.
Henry VIII	5	4	3329	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
Henry VIII	5	4	3330	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	His honor and the greatness of his name
Henry VIII	5	4	3331	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish,
Henry VIII	5	4	3332	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And like a mountain cedar reach his branches
Henry VIII	5	4	3333	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	To all the plains about him. Our children’s children
Henry VIII	5	4	3334	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Shall see this and bless heaven.
Henry VIII	5	4	3335	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Thou speakest wonders.
Henry VIII	5	4	3336	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	She shall be to the happiness of England
Henry VIII	5	4	3337	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	An agèd princess; many days shall see her,
Henry VIII	5	4	3338	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Henry VIII	5	4	3339	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	Would I had known no more! But she must die,
Henry VIII	5	4	3340	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
Henry VIII	5	4	3341	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	A most unspotted lily, shall she pass
Henry VIII	5	4	3342	speech	verse	Cranmer_H8	To th’ ground, and all the world shall mourn her.
Henry VIII	5	4	3343	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	O lord Archbishop,
Henry VIII	5	4	3344	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	Thou hast made me now a man. Never before
Henry VIII	5	4	3345	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	This happy child did I get anything.
Henry VIII	5	4	3346	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	This oracle of comfort has so pleased me
Henry VIII	5	4	3347	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	That when I am in heaven I shall desire
Henry VIII	5	4	3348	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	To see what this child does and praise my Maker.—
Henry VIII	5	4	3349	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	I thank you all.—To you, my good lord mayor
Henry VIII	5	4	3350	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	And you, good brethren, I am much beholding.

Henry VIII	5	4	3353	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	You must all see the Queen, and she must thank you;

Henry VIII	5	4	3355	speech	verse	HenryVIII_H8	’Has business at his house, for all shall stay.
