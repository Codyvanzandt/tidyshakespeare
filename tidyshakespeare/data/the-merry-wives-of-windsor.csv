But if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope upon familiarity will grow more content. But if you say “Marry her,” I will marry her. That I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	1	1	124	speech	prose	HughEvans_Wiv	It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the ’ord “dissolutely.” The ’ort is, according to our meaning, “resolutely.” His meaning is good.

I bruised my shin th’ other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence—three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes—and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i’ th’ town?

What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I’ll exhibit a bill in the Parliament for the putting down of men. How shall I be revenged on him?

But they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of “Greensleeves.“ What tempest, I trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?

Well, I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	1	361	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Nay, I know not. It makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I’ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	1	363	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	So will I. If he come under my hatches, I’ll never to sea again. Let’s be revenged on him. Let’s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay till he hath pawned his horses to mine Host of the Garter.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	1	364	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	1	365	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Why, look where he comes, and my good man too. He’s as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance.

Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so sweetly—all musk—and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any woman’s heart; and, I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty. And, I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all. And yet there has been earls—nay, which is more, pensioners—but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	489	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	490	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a thousand times, and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	491	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Ten and eleven?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	492	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	493	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her. I will not fail her.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	494	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your Worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and, let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe’er be the other. And she bade me tell your Worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely, I think you have charms, la! Yes, in truth.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	495	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	497	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	But I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they love me?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	498	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvelous infection to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list—all is as she will. And, truly, she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	499	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why, I will.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	2	2	500	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Nay, but do so then, and, look you, he may come and go between you both. And in any case have a nayword, that you may know one another’s mind, and the boy never need to understand anything; for ’tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.

Briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed I am sure I have received none, unless experience be a jewel.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	3	3	822	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house.

In the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a basket. If he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking. Or—it is whiting time—send him by your two men to Datchet Mead.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	3	5	1048	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	By the Lord, a buck-basket! Rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	3	5	1049	direction	modifier	MasterFord_Wiv	, as Brook
The Merry Wives of Windsor	3	5	1050	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	And how long lay you there?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	3	5	1051	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane. They took me on their shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in the door, who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it, but fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether; next, to be compassed, like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that, a man of my kidney—think of that—that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to ’scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half-stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames and cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a horseshoe! Think of that—hissing hot—think of that, Master Brook.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	3	5	1054	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding. I have received from her another embassy of meeting. ’Twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.

Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her, Master Brook. Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.

There’s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This ’tis to be married; this ’tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take the lecher. He is at my house. He cannot ’scape me. ’Tis impossible he should. He cannot creep into a half-penny purse, nor into a pepper-box. But lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go with me: I’ll be horn-mad.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1130	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again. He so takes on yonder with my husband, so rails against all married mankind, so curses all Eve’s daughters of what complexion soever, and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying “Peer out, peer out!” that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1131	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	Why, does he talk of him?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1132	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here. Now he shall see his own foolery.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1137	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	Which way should he go? How should I bestow him? Shall I put him into the basket again?

The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1146	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I’ll go out, then.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1147	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John—unless you go out disguised.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1148	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	How might we disguise him?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1149	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Alas the day, I know not. There is no woman’s gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1160	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	We’ll try that; for I’ll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they did last time.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	4	2	1161	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Nay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go dress him like the witch of Brentford.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1593	speech	verse	MasterPage_Wiv	Will none but Herne the Hunter serve your turn?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1594	speech	verse	MistressPage_Wiv	I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.—
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1595	speech	verse	MistressPage_Wiv	Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1597	speech	verse	MistressPage_Wiv	See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1599	direction	delivery	MasterFord_Wiv	, to Falstaff
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1600	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff’s a knave, a cuckoldly knave. Here are his horns, Master Brook. And, Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook. His horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1601	speech	prose	MistressFord_Wiv	Sir John, we have had ill luck. We could never meet. I will never take you for my love again, but I will always count you my deer.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1602	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1603	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs are extant.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1604	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	And these are not fairies. I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when ’tis upon ill employment.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1605	speech	prose	HughEvans_Wiv	Sir John Falstaff, serve Got and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1606	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	Well said, Fairy Hugh.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1607	speech	prose	HughEvans_Wiv	And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1608	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1609	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze? ’Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1610	speech	prose	HughEvans_Wiv	Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is all putter.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1611	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	“Seese” and “putter”? Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late walking through the realm.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1612	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Why, Sir John, do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1613	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1618	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	And as wicked as his wife?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1619	speech	prose	HughEvans_Wiv	And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings and swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1620	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Well, I am your theme. You have the start of me. I am dejected. I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet o’er me. Use me as you will.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1621	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and above that you have suffered, I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1622	speech	prose	MasterPage_Wiv	Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1623	direction	delivery	MistressPage_Wiv	, aside
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1624	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Doctors doubt that. If Anne Page be my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius’ wife.

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1628	speech	prose	Slender_Wiv	“Dispatched”? I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on ’t. Would I were hanged, la, else!
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1629	speech	prose	MasterPage_Wiv	Of what, son?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1630	speech	prose	Slender_Wiv	I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she’s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i’ th’ church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! And ’tis a post-master’s boy.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1631	speech	prose	MasterPage_Wiv	Upon my life, then, you took the wrong—
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1632	speech	prose	Slender_Wiv	What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman’s apparel, I would not have had him.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1633	speech	prose	MasterPage_Wiv	Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1634	speech	prose	Slender_Wiv	I went to her in white, and cried “mum,” and she cried “budget,” as Anne and I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a post-master’s boy.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1635	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose, turned my daughter into green, and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1636	direction	entrance	DoctorCaius_Wiv	Enter Doctor Caius.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1637	speech	prose	DoctorCaius_Wiv	Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened! I ha’ married un garçon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am cozened.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1638	speech	prose	MistressPage_Wiv	Why? Did you take her in green?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1639	speech	prose	DoctorCaius_Wiv	Ay, be gar, and ’tis a boy. Be gar, I’ll raise all Windsor.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1640	speech	prose	MasterFord_Wiv	This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1643	speech	prose	AnnePage_Wiv	Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1644	speech	prose	MasterPage_Wiv	Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1645	speech	verse	MistressPage_Wiv	Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1646	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1647	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	You would have married her most shamefully,
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1648	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	Where there was no proportion held in love.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1649	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1650	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1651	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	Th’ offense is holy that she hath committed,
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1652	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	And this deceit loses the name of craft,
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1653	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1654	speech	verse	Fenton_Wiv	Since therein she doth evitate and shun

The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1660	speech	verse	MasterFord_Wiv	Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1661	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I am glad, though you have ta’en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1662	speech	verse	MasterPage_Wiv	Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1663	speech	verse	MasterPage_Wiv	What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1664	speech	verse	Falstaff_1H4	When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
The Merry Wives of Windsor	5	5	1665	speech	verse	MistressPage_Wiv	Well, I will muse no further.—Master Fenton,
