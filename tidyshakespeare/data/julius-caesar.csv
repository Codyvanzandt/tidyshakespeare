Julius Caesar	1	1	2	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!
Julius Caesar	1	1	3	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
Julius Caesar	1	1	4	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Julius Caesar	1	1	5	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	Upon a laboring day without the sign
Julius Caesar	1	1	6	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	Of your profession?—Speak, what trade art thou?
Julius Caesar	1	1	7	speech	prose	COMMONERS.Carpenter_JC	Why, sir, a carpenter.
Julius Caesar	1	1	8	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
Julius Caesar	1	1	9	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	What dost thou with thy best apparel on?—
Julius Caesar	1	1	10	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	You, sir, what trade are you?
Julius Caesar	1	1	11	speech	prose	COMMONERS.Cobbler_JC	Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.
Julius Caesar	1	1	12	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
Julius Caesar	1	1	13	speech	prose	COMMONERS.Cobbler_JC	A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

Julius Caesar	1	1	19	speech	prose	COMMONERS.Cobbler_JC	Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl. I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.
Julius Caesar	1	1	20	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Julius Caesar	1	1	21	speech	verse	Flavius_JC	Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

Julius Caesar	1	1	27	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Julius Caesar	1	1	28	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Julius Caesar	1	1	29	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
Julius Caesar	1	1	30	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
Julius Caesar	1	1	31	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
Julius Caesar	1	1	32	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	The livelong day, with patient expectation,
Julius Caesar	1	1	33	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
Julius Caesar	1	1	34	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Julius Caesar	1	1	35	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Have you not made an universal shout,
Julius Caesar	1	1	36	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
Julius Caesar	1	1	37	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	To hear the replication of your sounds
Julius Caesar	1	1	38	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Made in her concave shores?
Julius Caesar	1	1	39	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	And do you now put on your best attire?
Julius Caesar	1	1	40	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	And do you now cull out a holiday?
Julius Caesar	1	1	41	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	And do you now strew flowers in his way
Julius Caesar	1	1	42	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?
Julius Caesar	1	1	43	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Be gone!
Julius Caesar	1	1	44	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Julius Caesar	1	1	45	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
Julius Caesar	1	1	46	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	That needs must light on this ingratitude.

Julius Caesar	1	1	58	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	May we do so?
Julius Caesar	1	1	59	speech	verse	Marullus_JC	You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

Julius Caesar	1	2	108	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
Julius Caesar	1	2	109	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I’ll leave you.
Julius Caesar	1	2	110	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Brutus, I do observe you now of late.
Julius Caesar	1	2	111	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I have not from your eyes that gentleness
Julius Caesar	1	2	112	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And show of love as I was wont to have.
Julius Caesar	1	2	113	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Julius Caesar	1	2	114	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Over your friend that loves you.
Julius Caesar	1	2	115	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Cassius,
Julius Caesar	1	2	116	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,
Julius Caesar	1	2	117	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I turn the trouble of my countenance
Julius Caesar	1	2	118	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am
Julius Caesar	1	2	119	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Of late with passions of some difference,
Julius Caesar	1	2	120	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Conceptions only proper to myself,
Julius Caesar	1	2	121	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.
Julius Caesar	1	2	122	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
Julius Caesar	1	2	123	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)
Julius Caesar	1	2	124	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Nor construe any further my neglect
Julius Caesar	1	2	125	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Julius Caesar	1	2	126	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Forgets the shows of love to other men.
Julius Caesar	1	2	127	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
Julius Caesar	1	2	128	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Julius Caesar	1	2	129	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Julius Caesar	1	2	130	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
Julius Caesar	1	2	131	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
Julius Caesar	1	2	132	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	But by reflection, by some other things.
Julius Caesar	1	2	133	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	’Tis just.
Julius Caesar	1	2	134	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
Julius Caesar	1	2	135	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Julius Caesar	1	2	136	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
Julius Caesar	1	2	137	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That you might see your shadow. I have heard
Julius Caesar	1	2	138	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Julius Caesar	1	2	139	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
Julius Caesar	1	2	140	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,
Julius Caesar	1	2	141	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.
Julius Caesar	1	2	142	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
Julius Caesar	1	2	143	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That you would have me seek into myself
Julius Caesar	1	2	144	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	For that which is not in me?
Julius Caesar	1	2	145	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.
Julius Caesar	1	2	146	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And since you know you cannot see yourself
Julius Caesar	1	2	147	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Julius Caesar	1	2	148	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Will modestly discover to yourself
Julius Caesar	1	2	149	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That of yourself which you yet know not of.
Julius Caesar	1	2	150	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.
Julius Caesar	1	2	151	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Were I a common laughter, or did use
Julius Caesar	1	2	152	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To stale with ordinary oaths my love
Julius Caesar	1	2	153	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To every new protester; if you know
Julius Caesar	1	2	154	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
Julius Caesar	1	2	155	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And after scandal them, or if you know
Julius Caesar	1	2	156	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That I profess myself in banqueting

Julius Caesar	1	2	162	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Ay, do you fear it?
Julius Caesar	1	2	163	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Then must I think you would not have it so.
Julius Caesar	1	2	164	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
Julius Caesar	1	2	165	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
Julius Caesar	1	2	166	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	What is it that you would impart to me?
Julius Caesar	1	2	167	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	If it be aught toward the general good,
Julius Caesar	1	2	168	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other
Julius Caesar	1	2	169	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And I will look on both indifferently;
Julius Caesar	1	2	170	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	For let the gods so speed me as I love
Julius Caesar	1	2	171	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The name of honor more than I fear death.
Julius Caesar	1	2	172	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
Julius Caesar	1	2	173	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	As well as I do know your outward favor.
Julius Caesar	1	2	174	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Well, honor is the subject of my story.
Julius Caesar	1	2	175	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I cannot tell what you and other men
Julius Caesar	1	2	176	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Think of this life; but, for my single self,
Julius Caesar	1	2	177	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I had as lief not be as live to be
Julius Caesar	1	2	178	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	In awe of such a thing as I myself.
Julius Caesar	1	2	179	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I was born free as Caesar; so were you;
Julius Caesar	1	2	180	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	We both have fed as well, and we can both
Julius Caesar	1	2	181	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.
Julius Caesar	1	2	182	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
Julius Caesar	1	2	183	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Julius Caesar	1	2	184	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now
Julius Caesar	1	2	185	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Leap in with me into this angry flood
Julius Caesar	1	2	186	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,
Julius Caesar	1	2	187	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in
Julius Caesar	1	2	188	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
Julius Caesar	1	2	189	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	The torrent roared, and we did buffet it
Julius Caesar	1	2	190	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
Julius Caesar	1	2	191	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
Julius Caesar	1	2	192	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Julius Caesar	1	2	193	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”
Julius Caesar	1	2	194	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Julius Caesar	1	2	195	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
Julius Caesar	1	2	196	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Julius Caesar	1	2	197	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Julius Caesar	1	2	198	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Is now become a god, and Cassius is
Julius Caesar	1	2	199	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	A wretched creature and must bend his body
Julius Caesar	1	2	200	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
Julius Caesar	1	2	201	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	He had a fever when he was in Spain,
Julius Caesar	1	2	202	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And when the fit was on him, I did mark
Julius Caesar	1	2	203	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake.
Julius Caesar	1	2	204	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	His coward lips did from their color fly,
Julius Caesar	1	2	205	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Julius Caesar	1	2	206	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.
Julius Caesar	1	2	207	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Julius Caesar	1	2	208	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Julius Caesar	1	2	209	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	“Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius”
Julius Caesar	1	2	210	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me

Julius Caesar	1	2	217	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I do believe that these applauses are
Julius Caesar	1	2	218	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
Julius Caesar	1	2	219	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Julius Caesar	1	2	220	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Julius Caesar	1	2	221	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Walk under his huge legs and peep about
Julius Caesar	1	2	222	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Julius Caesar	1	2	223	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Men at some time are masters of their fates.
Julius Caesar	1	2	224	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
Julius Caesar	1	2	225	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Julius Caesar	1	2	226	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	“Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”?
Julius Caesar	1	2	227	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Julius Caesar	1	2	228	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Julius Caesar	1	2	229	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Julius Caesar	1	2	230	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,
Julius Caesar	1	2	231	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”
Julius Caesar	1	2	232	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Julius Caesar	1	2	233	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
Julius Caesar	1	2	234	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Julius Caesar	1	2	235	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
Julius Caesar	1	2	236	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	When went there by an age, since the great flood,
Julius Caesar	1	2	237	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But it was famed with more than with one man?
Julius Caesar	1	2	238	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,
Julius Caesar	1	2	239	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That her wide walks encompassed but one man?
Julius Caesar	1	2	240	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough
Julius Caesar	1	2	241	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	When there is in it but one only man.
Julius Caesar	1	2	242	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	O, you and I have heard our fathers say
Julius Caesar	1	2	243	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	There was a Brutus once that would have brooked
Julius Caesar	1	2	244	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
Julius Caesar	1	2	245	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	As easily as a king.
Julius Caesar	1	2	246	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.
Julius Caesar	1	2	247	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	What you would work me to, I have some aim.
Julius Caesar	1	2	248	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	How I have thought of this, and of these times,
Julius Caesar	1	2	249	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I shall recount hereafter. For this present,
Julius Caesar	1	2	250	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Julius Caesar	1	2	251	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Be any further moved. What you have said
Julius Caesar	1	2	252	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I will consider; what you have to say
Julius Caesar	1	2	253	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I will with patience hear, and find a time
Julius Caesar	1	2	254	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Julius Caesar	1	2	255	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Julius Caesar	1	2	256	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Brutus had rather be a villager
Julius Caesar	1	2	257	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Julius Caesar	1	2	258	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Under these hard conditions as this time
Julius Caesar	1	2	259	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Is like to lay upon us.
Julius Caesar	1	2	260	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I am glad that my weak words
Julius Caesar	1	2	261	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

Julius Caesar	1	2	266	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	What hath proceeded worthy note today.
Julius Caesar	1	2	267	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I will do so. But look you, Cassius,
Julius Caesar	1	2	268	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,
Julius Caesar	1	2	269	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And all the rest look like a chidden train.
Julius Caesar	1	2	270	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero
Julius Caesar	1	2	271	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
Julius Caesar	1	2	272	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	As we have seen him in the Capitol,

Julius Caesar	1	2	274	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
Julius Caesar	1	2	275	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Antonius.
Julius Caesar	1	2	276	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Caesar.
Julius Caesar	1	2	277	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Let me have men about me that are fat,
Julius Caesar	1	2	278	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.
Julius Caesar	1	2	279	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
Julius Caesar	1	2	280	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.
Julius Caesar	1	2	281	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous.
Julius Caesar	1	2	282	speech	verse	Antony_JC	He is a noble Roman, and well given.
Julius Caesar	1	2	283	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not.
Julius Caesar	1	2	284	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Yet if my name were liable to fear,
Julius Caesar	1	2	285	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	I do not know the man I should avoid
Julius Caesar	1	2	286	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,
Julius Caesar	1	2	287	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	He is a great observer, and he looks
Julius Caesar	1	2	288	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,
Julius Caesar	1	2	289	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Julius Caesar	1	2	290	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
Julius Caesar	1	2	291	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit
Julius Caesar	1	2	292	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	That could be moved to smile at anything.
Julius Caesar	1	2	293	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Such men as he be never at heart’s ease
Julius Caesar	1	2	294	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
Julius Caesar	1	2	295	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	And therefore are they very dangerous.
Julius Caesar	1	2	296	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	I rather tell thee what is to be feared
Julius Caesar	1	2	297	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Julius Caesar	1	2	298	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,

Julius Caesar	1	2	303	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today
Julius Caesar	1	2	304	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That Caesar looks so sad.
Julius Caesar	1	2	305	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Why, you were with him, were you not?
Julius Caesar	1	2	306	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
Julius Caesar	1	2	307	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.
Julius Caesar	1	2	308	speech	prose	Brutus_JC	What was the second noise for?
Julius Caesar	1	2	309	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Why, for that too.
Julius Caesar	1	2	310	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
Julius Caesar	1	2	311	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Why, for that too.
Julius Caesar	1	2	312	speech	prose	Brutus_JC	Was the crown offered him thrice?
Julius Caesar	1	2	313	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted.
Julius Caesar	1	2	314	speech	prose	Cassius_JC	Who offered him the crown?
Julius Caesar	1	2	315	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Why, Antony.
Julius Caesar	1	2	316	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
Julius Caesar	1	2	317	speech	prose	Casca_JC	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
Julius Caesar	1	2	318	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?
Julius Caesar	1	2	319	speech	prose	Casca_JC	He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless.
Julius Caesar	1	2	320	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.
Julius Caesar	1	2	321	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I
Julius Caesar	1	2	322	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
Julius Caesar	1	2	323	speech	prose	Casca_JC	I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man.
Julius Caesar	1	2	324	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	What said he when he came unto himself?
Julius Caesar	1	2	325	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
Julius Caesar	1	2	326	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And, after that, he came thus sad away?
Julius Caesar	1	2	327	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Ay.
Julius Caesar	1	2	328	speech	prose	Cassius_JC	Did Cicero say anything?
Julius Caesar	1	2	329	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Ay, he spoke Greek.
Julius Caesar	1	2	330	speech	prose	Cassius_JC	To what effect?
Julius Caesar	1	2	331	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.
Julius Caesar	1	2	332	speech	prose	Cassius_JC	Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
Julius Caesar	1	2	333	speech	prose	Casca_JC	No, I am promised forth.
Julius Caesar	1	2	334	speech	prose	Cassius_JC	Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Julius Caesar	1	2	335	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.
Julius Caesar	1	2	336	speech	prose	Cassius_JC	Good. I will expect you.
Julius Caesar	1	2	337	speech	prose	Casca_JC	Do so. Farewell both.

Julius Caesar	1	2	339	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!

Julius Caesar	1	2	341	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	So is he now in execution
Julius Caesar	1	2	342	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Of any bold or noble enterprise,
Julius Caesar	1	2	343	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	However he puts on this tardy form.
Julius Caesar	1	2	344	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Julius Caesar	1	2	345	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Which gives men stomach to digest his words
Julius Caesar	1	2	346	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	With better appetite.
Julius Caesar	1	2	347	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
Julius Caesar	1	2	348	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
Julius Caesar	1	2	349	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Julius Caesar	1	2	350	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.

Julius Caesar	1	2	353	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see

Julius Caesar	1	2	355	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet

Julius Caesar	1	2	357	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Julius Caesar	1	2	358	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
Julius Caesar	1	2	359	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,
Julius Caesar	1	2	360	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	He should not humor me. I will this night
Julius Caesar	1	2	361	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	In several hands in at his windows throw,
Julius Caesar	1	2	362	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	As if they came from several citizens,
Julius Caesar	1	2	363	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Writings, all tending to the great opinion
Julius Caesar	1	2	364	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
Julius Caesar	1	2	365	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at

Julius Caesar	1	3	374	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Julius Caesar	1	3	375	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
Julius Caesar	1	3	376	speech	verse	Casca_JC	I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Julius Caesar	1	3	377	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
Julius Caesar	1	3	378	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
Julius Caesar	1	3	379	speech	verse	Casca_JC	To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds;
Julius Caesar	1	3	380	speech	verse	Casca_JC	But never till tonight, never till now,
Julius Caesar	1	3	381	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Julius Caesar	1	3	382	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Julius Caesar	1	3	383	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Julius Caesar	1	3	384	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Incenses them to send destruction.
Julius Caesar	1	3	385	speech	verse	Cicero_JC	Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
Julius Caesar	1	3	386	speech	verse	Casca_JC	A common slave (you know him well by sight)
Julius Caesar	1	3	387	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Julius Caesar	1	3	388	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand,
Julius Caesar	1	3	389	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched.
Julius Caesar	1	3	390	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Besides (I ha’ not since put up my sword),
Julius Caesar	1	3	391	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Julius Caesar	1	3	392	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Who glazed upon me and went surly by
Julius Caesar	1	3	393	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Without annoying me. And there were drawn
Julius Caesar	1	3	394	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Julius Caesar	1	3	395	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw
Julius Caesar	1	3	396	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
Julius Caesar	1	3	397	speech	verse	Casca_JC	And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Julius Caesar	1	3	398	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Even at noonday upon the marketplace,
Julius Caesar	1	3	399	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies

Julius Caesar	1	3	401	speech	verse	Casca_JC	“These are their reasons, they are natural,”
Julius Caesar	1	3	402	speech	verse	Casca_JC	For I believe they are portentous things

Julius Caesar	1	3	404	speech	verse	Cicero_JC	Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.

Julius Caesar	1	3	418	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
Julius Caesar	1	3	419	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	A very pleasing night to honest men.
Julius Caesar	1	3	420	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
Julius Caesar	1	3	421	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Those that have known the Earth so full of faults.
Julius Caesar	1	3	422	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For my part, I have walked about the streets,
Julius Caesar	1	3	423	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Submitting me unto the perilous night,
Julius Caesar	1	3	424	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,
Julius Caesar	1	3	425	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
Julius Caesar	1	3	426	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open
Julius Caesar	1	3	427	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Julius Caesar	1	3	428	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Even in the aim and very flash of it.
Julius Caesar	1	3	429	speech	verse	Casca_JC	But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
Julius Caesar	1	3	430	speech	verse	Casca_JC	It is the part of men to fear and tremble
Julius Caesar	1	3	431	speech	verse	Casca_JC	When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Julius Caesar	1	3	432	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

Julius Caesar	1	3	434	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That should be in a Roman you do want,
Julius Caesar	1	3	435	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,
Julius Caesar	1	3	436	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,
Julius Caesar	1	3	437	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
Julius Caesar	1	3	438	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But if you would consider the true cause

Julius Caesar	1	3	443	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Their natures, and preformèd faculties,
Julius Caesar	1	3	444	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To monstrous quality—why, you shall find
Julius Caesar	1	3	445	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
Julius Caesar	1	3	446	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To make them instruments of fear and warning
Julius Caesar	1	3	447	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Unto some monstrous state.
Julius Caesar	1	3	448	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Julius Caesar	1	3	449	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Most like this dreadful night,
Julius Caesar	1	3	450	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
Julius Caesar	1	3	451	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	As doth the lion in the Capitol;
Julius Caesar	1	3	452	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	A man no mightier than thyself or me
Julius Caesar	1	3	453	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	In personal action, yet prodigious grown,
Julius Caesar	1	3	454	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
Julius Caesar	1	3	455	speech	verse	Casca_JC	’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
Julius Caesar	1	3	456	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Let it be who it is. For Romans now
Julius Caesar	1	3	457	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
Julius Caesar	1	3	458	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,
Julius Caesar	1	3	459	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits.
Julius Caesar	1	3	460	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
Julius Caesar	1	3	461	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow
Julius Caesar	1	3	462	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
Julius Caesar	1	3	463	speech	verse	Casca_JC	And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
Julius Caesar	1	3	464	speech	verse	Casca_JC	In every place save here in Italy.
Julius Caesar	1	3	465	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Julius Caesar	1	3	466	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
Julius Caesar	1	3	467	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;
Julius Caesar	1	3	468	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat.
Julius Caesar	1	3	469	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Julius Caesar	1	3	470	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Julius Caesar	1	3	471	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
Julius Caesar	1	3	472	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Julius Caesar	1	3	473	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
Julius Caesar	1	3	474	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	If I know this, know all the world besides,
Julius Caesar	1	3	475	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That part of tyranny that I do bear
Julius Caesar	1	3	476	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I can shake off at pleasure.
Julius Caesar	1	3	477	direction	sound		Thunder still.
Julius Caesar	1	3	478	speech	verse	Casca_JC	So can I.
Julius Caesar	1	3	479	speech	verse	Casca_JC	So every bondman in his own hand bears
Julius Caesar	1	3	480	speech	verse	Casca_JC	The power to cancel his captivity.
Julius Caesar	1	3	481	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?
Julius Caesar	1	3	482	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf
Julius Caesar	1	3	483	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;
Julius Caesar	1	3	484	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Julius Caesar	1	3	485	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Julius Caesar	1	3	486	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,
Julius Caesar	1	3	487	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	What rubbish, and what offal when it serves
Julius Caesar	1	3	488	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For the base matter to illuminate
Julius Caesar	1	3	489	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Julius Caesar	1	3	490	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Julius Caesar	1	3	491	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Before a willing bondman; then, I know
Julius Caesar	1	3	492	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	My answer must be made. But I am armed,
Julius Caesar	1	3	493	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And dangers are to me indifferent.
Julius Caesar	1	3	494	speech	verse	Casca_JC	You speak to Casca, and to such a man
Julius Caesar	1	3	495	speech	verse	Casca_JC	That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand.

Julius Caesar	1	3	496	direction	business	Cassius_JC	They shake hands.
Julius Caesar	1	3	497	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
Julius Caesar	1	3	498	speech	verse	Casca_JC	And I will set this foot of mine as far
Julius Caesar	1	3	499	speech	verse	Casca_JC	As who goes farthest.
Julius Caesar	1	3	500	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	There’s a bargain made.
Julius Caesar	1	3	501	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Julius Caesar	1	3	502	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
Julius Caesar	1	3	503	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To undergo with me an enterprise
Julius Caesar	1	3	504	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Of honorable-dangerous consequence.
Julius Caesar	1	3	505	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And I do know by this they stay for me
Julius Caesar	1	3	506	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,
Julius Caesar	1	3	507	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	There is no stir or walking in the streets;
Julius Caesar	1	3	508	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And the complexion of the element
Julius Caesar	1	3	509	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	In favor ’s like the work we have in hand,

Julius Caesar	1	3	512	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
Julius Caesar	1	3	513	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.
Julius Caesar	1	3	514	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	He is a friend.—Cinna, where haste you so?
Julius Caesar	1	3	515	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?
Julius Caesar	1	3	516	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	No, it is Casca, one incorporate
Julius Caesar	1	3	517	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
Julius Caesar	1	3	518	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	I am glad on ’t. What a fearful night is this!
Julius Caesar	1	3	519	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
Julius Caesar	1	3	520	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Am I not stayed for? Tell me.
Julius Caesar	1	3	521	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could

Julius Caesar	1	3	524	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
Julius Caesar	1	3	525	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair,
Julius Caesar	1	3	526	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
Julius Caesar	1	3	527	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	In at his window; set this up with wax
Julius Caesar	1	3	528	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,
Julius Caesar	1	3	529	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.
Julius Caesar	1	3	530	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
Julius Caesar	1	3	531	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone
Julius Caesar	1	3	532	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
Julius Caesar	1	3	533	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
Julius Caesar	1	3	534	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	That done, repair to Pompey’s Theater.

Julius Caesar	1	3	536	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
Julius Caesar	1	3	537	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him
Julius Caesar	1	3	538	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Is ours already, and the man entire
Julius Caesar	1	3	539	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
Julius Caesar	1	3	540	speech	verse	Casca_JC	O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts,
Julius Caesar	1	3	541	speech	verse	Casca_JC	And that which would appear offense in us
Julius Caesar	1	3	542	speech	verse	Casca_JC	His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Julius Caesar	1	3	543	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
Julius Caesar	1	3	544	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Him and his worth and our great need of him
Julius Caesar	1	3	545	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	You have right well conceited. Let us go,
Julius Caesar	1	3	546	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For it is after midnight, and ere day
Julius Caesar	1	3	547	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	We will awake him and be sure of him.

Julius Caesar	2	1	550	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	What, Lucius, ho!—
Julius Caesar	2	1	551	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I cannot by the progress of the stars
Julius Caesar	2	1	552	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Give guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say!—
Julius Caesar	2	1	553	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.—

Julius Caesar	2	1	560	direction	exit	Lucius_JC	He exits.
Julius Caesar	2	1	561	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	It must be by his death. And for my part
Julius Caesar	2	1	562	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
Julius Caesar	2	1	563	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	But for the general. He would be crowned:
Julius Caesar	2	1	564	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	How that might change his nature, there’s the question.
Julius Caesar	2	1	565	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
Julius Caesar	2	1	566	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
Julius Caesar	2	1	567	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And then I grant we put a sting in him
Julius Caesar	2	1	568	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That at his will he may do danger with.
Julius Caesar	2	1	569	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Julius Caesar	2	1	570	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,
Julius Caesar	2	1	571	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I have not known when his affections swayed
Julius Caesar	2	1	572	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof
Julius Caesar	2	1	573	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,
Julius Caesar	2	1	574	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
Julius Caesar	2	1	575	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	But, when he once attains the upmost round,
Julius Caesar	2	1	576	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Julius Caesar	2	1	577	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
Julius Caesar	2	1	578	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
Julius Caesar	2	1	579	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel
Julius Caesar	2	1	580	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Will bear no color for the thing he is,
Julius Caesar	2	1	581	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,
Julius Caesar	2	1	582	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Would run to these and these extremities.
Julius Caesar	2	1	583	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,
Julius Caesar	2	1	584	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
Julius Caesar	2	1	585	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And kill him in the shell.

Julius Caesar	2	1	587	speech	verse	Lucius_JC	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Julius Caesar	2	1	588	speech	verse	Lucius_JC	Searching the window for a flint, I found
Julius Caesar	2	1	589	speech	verse	Lucius_JC	This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure

Julius Caesar	2	1	593	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
Julius Caesar	2	1	594	speech	prose	Lucius_JC	I know not, sir.
Julius Caesar	2	1	595	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
Julius Caesar	2	1	596	speech	prose	Lucius_JC	I will, sir.
Julius Caesar	2	1	597	direction	exit	Lucius_JC	He exits.
Julius Caesar	2	1	598	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The exhalations, whizzing in the air,
Julius Caesar	2	1	599	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Give so much light that I may read by them.
Julius Caesar	2	1	600	direction	business	Brutus_JC	Opens the letter and reads.

Julius Caesar	2	1	603	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	“Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake.”
Julius Caesar	2	1	604	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Such instigations have been often dropped
Julius Caesar	2	1	605	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Where I have took them up.
Julius Caesar	2	1	606	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	“Shall Rome, etc.” Thus must I piece it out:
Julius Caesar	2	1	607	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?
Julius Caesar	2	1	608	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
Julius Caesar	2	1	609	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The Tarquin drive when he was called a king.
Julius Caesar	2	1	610	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated
Julius Caesar	2	1	611	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
Julius Caesar	2	1	612	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Julius Caesar	2	1	613	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.

Julius Caesar	2	1	619	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
Julius Caesar	2	1	620	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	I have not slept.
Julius Caesar	2	1	621	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Between the acting of a dreadful thing
Julius Caesar	2	1	622	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And the first motion, all the interim is
Julius Caesar	2	1	623	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.
Julius Caesar	2	1	624	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The genius and the mortal instruments
Julius Caesar	2	1	625	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Are then in council, and the state of man,
Julius Caesar	2	1	626	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
Julius Caesar	2	1	627	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The nature of an insurrection.

Julius Caesar	2	1	632	speech	verse	Lucius_JC	No, sir. There are more with him.
Julius Caesar	2	1	633	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Do you know them?
Julius Caesar	2	1	634	speech	verse	Lucius_JC	No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,
Julius Caesar	2	1	635	speech	verse	Lucius_JC	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,

Julius Caesar	2	1	688	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	As I am sure they do—bear fire enough
Julius Caesar	2	1	689	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
Julius Caesar	2	1	690	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
Julius Caesar	2	1	691	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	What need we any spur but our own cause
Julius Caesar	2	1	692	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To prick us to redress? What other bond
Julius Caesar	2	1	693	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
Julius Caesar	2	1	694	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And will not palter? And what other oath
Julius Caesar	2	1	695	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Than honesty to honesty engaged
Julius Caesar	2	1	696	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That this shall be or we will fall for it?
Julius Caesar	2	1	697	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,

Julius Caesar	2	1	702	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
Julius Caesar	2	1	703	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To think that or our cause or our performance
Julius Caesar	2	1	704	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Did need an oath, when every drop of blood
Julius Caesar	2	1	705	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Julius Caesar	2	1	706	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Is guilty of a several bastardy
Julius Caesar	2	1	707	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	If he do break the smallest particle
Julius Caesar	2	1	708	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Of any promise that hath passed from him.
Julius Caesar	2	1	709	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
Julius Caesar	2	1	710	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I think he will stand very strong with us.
Julius Caesar	2	1	711	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Let us not leave him out.
Julius Caesar	2	1	712	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	No, by no means.
Julius Caesar	2	1	713	speech	verse	Metellus_JC	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Julius Caesar	2	1	714	speech	verse	Metellus_JC	Will purchase us a good opinion
Julius Caesar	2	1	715	speech	verse	Metellus_JC	And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.

Julius Caesar	2	1	717	speech	verse	Metellus_JC	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,

Julius Caesar	2	1	719	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	O, name him not! Let us not break with him,
Julius Caesar	2	1	720	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	For he will never follow anything
Julius Caesar	2	1	721	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	That other men begin.
Julius Caesar	2	1	722	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Then leave him out.
Julius Caesar	2	1	723	speech	verse	Casca_JC	Indeed, he is not fit.
Julius Caesar	2	1	724	speech	verse	Decius_JC	Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar?
Julius Caesar	2	1	725	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
Julius Caesar	2	1	726	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Julius Caesar	2	1	727	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him
Julius Caesar	2	1	728	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
Julius Caesar	2	1	729	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	If he improve them, may well stretch so far
Julius Caesar	2	1	730	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	As to annoy us all; which to prevent,
Julius Caesar	2	1	731	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
Julius Caesar	2	1	732	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
Julius Caesar	2	1	733	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Julius Caesar	2	1	734	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
Julius Caesar	2	1	735	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Julius Caesar	2	1	736	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
Julius Caesar	2	1	737	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
Julius Caesar	2	1	738	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
Julius Caesar	2	1	739	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit
Julius Caesar	2	1	740	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Julius Caesar	2	1	741	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,
Julius Caesar	2	1	742	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.
Julius Caesar	2	1	743	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Julius Caesar	2	1	744	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.
Julius Caesar	2	1	745	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Julius Caesar	2	1	746	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Stir up their servants to an act of rage
Julius Caesar	2	1	747	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And after seem to chide ’em. This shall make
Julius Caesar	2	1	748	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Our purpose necessary and not envious;
Julius Caesar	2	1	749	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Which so appearing to the common eyes,
Julius Caesar	2	1	750	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	We shall be called purgers, not murderers.
Julius Caesar	2	1	751	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
Julius Caesar	2	1	752	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm
Julius Caesar	2	1	753	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	When Caesar’s head is off.
Julius Caesar	2	1	754	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Yet I fear him,
Julius Caesar	2	1	755	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar—
Julius Caesar	2	1	756	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
Julius Caesar	2	1	757	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Julius Caesar	2	1	758	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.
Julius Caesar	2	1	759	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	And that were much he should, for he is given
Julius Caesar	2	1	760	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To sports, to wildness, and much company.
Julius Caesar	2	1	761	speech	verse	Trebonius_JC	There is no fear in him. Let him not die,

Julius Caesar	2	1	768	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,
Julius Caesar	2	1	769	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	For he is superstitious grown of late,
Julius Caesar	2	1	770	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Quite from the main opinion he held once
Julius Caesar	2	1	771	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.

Julius Caesar	2	1	774	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	And the persuasion of his augurers
Julius Caesar	2	1	775	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	May hold him from the Capitol today.
Julius Caesar	2	1	776	speech	verse	Decius_JC	Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
Julius Caesar	2	1	777	speech	verse	Decius_JC	I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear
Julius Caesar	2	1	778	speech	verse	Decius_JC	That unicorns may be betrayed with trees,
Julius Caesar	2	1	779	speech	verse	Decius_JC	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Julius Caesar	2	1	780	speech	verse	Decius_JC	Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.
Julius Caesar	2	1	781	speech	verse	Decius_JC	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
Julius Caesar	2	1	782	speech	verse	Decius_JC	He says he does, being then most flatterèd.
Julius Caesar	2	1	783	speech	verse	Decius_JC	Let me work,
Julius Caesar	2	1	784	speech	verse	Decius_JC	For I can give his humor the true bent,
Julius Caesar	2	1	785	speech	verse	Decius_JC	And I will bring him to the Capitol.

Julius Caesar	2	1	788	speech	verse	Cinna_JC	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
Julius Caesar	2	1	789	speech	verse	Metellus_JC	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
Julius Caesar	2	1	790	speech	verse	Metellus_JC	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.

Julius Caesar	2	1	816	speech	verse	Portia_JC	You suddenly arose and walked about,
Julius Caesar	2	1	817	speech	verse	Portia_JC	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,

Julius Caesar	2	2	942	speech	verse	Calphurnia_JC	You shall not stir out of your house today.
Julius Caesar	2	2	943	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me
Julius Caesar	2	2	944	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Ne’er looked but on my back. When they shall see
Julius Caesar	2	2	945	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	The face of Caesar, they are vanishèd.
Julius Caesar	2	2	946	speech	verse	Calphurnia_JC	Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Julius Caesar	2	2	947	speech	verse	Calphurnia_JC	Yet now they fright me. There is one within,

Julius Caesar	2	2	949	speech	verse	Calphurnia_JC	Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
Julius Caesar	2	2	950	speech	verse	Calphurnia_JC	A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets,

Julius Caesar	2	2	955	speech	verse	Calphurnia_JC	The noise of battle hurtled in the air,

Julius Caesar	2	2	1020	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
Julius Caesar	2	2	1021	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	And these does she apply for warnings and portents
Julius Caesar	2	2	1022	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	And evils imminent, and on her knee
Julius Caesar	2	2	1023	speech	verse	Caesar_JC	Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
Julius Caesar	2	2	1024	speech	verse	Decius_JC	This dream is all amiss interpreted.
Julius Caesar	2	2	1025	speech	verse	Decius_JC	It was a vision fair and fortunate.
Julius Caesar	2	2	1026	speech	verse	Decius_JC	Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
Julius Caesar	2	2	1027	speech	verse	Decius_JC	In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Julius Caesar	2	2	1028	speech	verse	Decius_JC	Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck

Julius Caesar	2	2	1030	speech	verse	Decius_JC	For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
Julius Caesar	2	2	1031	speech	verse	Decius_JC	This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.

Julius Caesar	2	2	1036	speech	verse	Decius_JC	If you shall send them word you will not come,

Julius Caesar	3	1	1351	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	(As fire drives out fire, so pity pity)
Julius Caesar	3	1	1352	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1353	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1354	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts
Julius Caesar	3	1	1355	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in
Julius Caesar	3	1	1356	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1357	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s

Julius Caesar	3	1	1364	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I doubt not of your wisdom.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1365	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Let each man render me his bloody hand.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1366	speech	verse	Antony_JC	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.—
Julius Caesar	3	1	1367	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.—

Julius Caesar	3	1	1369	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;—
Julius Caesar	3	1	1370	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.—
Julius Caesar	3	1	1371	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?
Julius Caesar	3	1	1372	speech	verse	Antony_JC	My credit now stands on such slippery ground
Julius Caesar	3	1	1373	speech	verse	Antony_JC	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,

Julius Caesar	3	1	1378	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To see thy Antony making his peace,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1379	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes—
Julius Caesar	3	1	1380	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse?
Julius Caesar	3	1	1381	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1382	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1383	speech	verse	Antony_JC	It would become me better than to close
Julius Caesar	3	1	1384	speech	verse	Antony_JC	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1385	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1386	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand
Julius Caesar	3	1	1387	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1388	speech	verse	Antony_JC	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1389	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.

Julius Caesar	3	1	1393	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1394	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
Julius Caesar	3	1	1395	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1396	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	I blame you not for praising Caesar so.
Julius Caesar	3	1	1397	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	But what compact mean you to have with us?
Julius Caesar	3	1	1398	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Will you be pricked in number of our friends,
Julius Caesar	3	1	1399	speech	verse	Cassius_JC	Or shall we on and not depend on you?

Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1507	speech	prose	PLEBEIANS_JC	None, Brutus, none.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1508	speech	prose	Brutus_JC	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1559	speech	verse	Antony_JC	He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1560	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1561	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
Julius Caesar	3	2	1562	speech	verse	Antony_JC	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;

Julius Caesar	3	2	1576	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me;
Julius Caesar	3	2	1577	speech	verse	Antony_JC	My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

Julius Caesar	3	2	1580	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.1_JC	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1581	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.2_JC	If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1582	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.2_JC	Caesar has had great wrong.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1583	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.3_JC	Has he, masters?
Julius Caesar	3	2	1584	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.3_JC	I fear there will a worse come in his place.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1586	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.4_JC	Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1587	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.1_JC	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1588	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.2_JC	Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1589	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.3_JC	There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1591	speech	verse	Antony_JC	But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Julius Caesar	3	2	1592	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1593	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And none so poor to do him reverence.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1594	speech	verse	Antony_JC	O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Julius Caesar	3	2	1595	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1596	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1597	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Who, you all know, are honorable men.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1598	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I will not do them wrong. I rather choose
Julius Caesar	3	2	1599	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1600	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Than I will wrong such honorable men.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1602	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1603	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Let but the commons hear this testament,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1604	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1605	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds

Julius Caesar	3	2	1607	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory
Julius Caesar	3	2	1608	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And, dying, mention it within their wills,

Julius Caesar	3	2	1610	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Unto their issue.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1611	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.4_JC	We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1620	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS.0.4_JC	Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1621	speech	verse	PLEBEIANS_JC	You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1622	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
Julius Caesar	3	2	1623	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1624	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I fear I wrong the honorable men
Julius Caesar	3	2	1625	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1626	speech	prose	PLEBEIANS.0.4_JC	They were traitors. Honorable men?
Julius Caesar	3	2	1627	speech	prose	PLEBEIANS_JC	The will! The testament!
Julius Caesar	3	2	1628	speech	prose	PLEBEIANS.0.2_JC	They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1641	speech	prose	PLEBEIANS_JC	Stand back! Room! Bear back!
Julius Caesar	3	2	1642	speech	verse	Antony_JC	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1643	speech	verse	Antony_JC	You all do know this mantle. I remember
Julius Caesar	3	2	1644	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The first time ever Caesar put it on.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1645	speech	verse	Antony_JC	’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1646	speech	verse	Antony_JC	That day he overcame the Nervii.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1647	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1648	speech	verse	Antony_JC	See what a rent the envious Casca made.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1649	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1650	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1651	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1652	speech	verse	Antony_JC	As rushing out of doors to be resolved
Julius Caesar	3	2	1653	speech	verse	Antony_JC	If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no;
Julius Caesar	3	2	1654	speech	verse	Antony_JC	For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1655	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
Julius Caesar	3	2	1656	speech	verse	Antony_JC	This was the most unkindest cut of all.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1657	speech	verse	Antony_JC	For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1658	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1659	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1660	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1661	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Even at the base of Pompey’s statue
Julius Caesar	3	2	1662	speech	verse	Antony_JC	(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1663	speech	verse	Antony_JC	O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

Julius Caesar	3	2	1682	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
Julius Caesar	3	2	1683	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1684	speech	verse	Antony_JC	They that have done this deed are honorable.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1685	speech	verse	Antony_JC	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1686	speech	verse	Antony_JC	That made them do it. They are wise and honorable
Julius Caesar	3	2	1687	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And will no doubt with reasons answer you.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1688	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1689	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I am no orator, as Brutus is,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1690	speech	verse	Antony_JC	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man
Julius Caesar	3	2	1691	speech	verse	Antony_JC	That love my friend, and that they know full well
Julius Caesar	3	2	1692	speech	verse	Antony_JC	That gave me public leave to speak of him.
Julius Caesar	3	2	1693	speech	verse	Antony_JC	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Julius Caesar	3	2	1694	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech
Julius Caesar	3	2	1695	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.

Julius Caesar	3	2	1697	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,

Julius Caesar	3	2	1700	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue

Julius Caesar	5	1	2396	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	Even by the rule of that philosophy
Julius Caesar	5	1	2397	speech	verse	Brutus_JC	By which I did blame Cato for the death
