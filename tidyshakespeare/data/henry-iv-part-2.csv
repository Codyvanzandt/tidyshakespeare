Henry IV, Part II	1	1	7	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	8	speech	verse	Porter_2H4	His Lordship is walked forth into the orchard.

Henry IV, Part II	1	1	14	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	15	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Should be the father of some stratagem.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	16	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	The times are wild. Contention, like a horse
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	17	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	18	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And bears down all before him.

Henry IV, Part II	1	1	21	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Good, an God will!
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	22	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	As good as heart can wish.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	23	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	The King is almost wounded to the death,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	24	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And, in the fortune of my lord your son,

Henry IV, Part II	1	1	26	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Killed by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	27	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	28	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	29	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	30	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	31	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Came not till now to dignify the times
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	32	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Since Caesar’s fortunes.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	33	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	How is this derived?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	34	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	35	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	36	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	A gentleman well bred and of good name,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	37	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	That freely rendered me these news for true.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	38	direction	entrance	Travers_2H4	Enter Travers.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	39	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Here comes my servant Travers, who I sent
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	40	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	On Tuesday last to listen after news.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	41	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	My lord, I overrode him on the way,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	42	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And he is furnished with no certainties
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	43	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	More than he haply may retail from me.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	44	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	45	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turned me back
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	46	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	With joyful tidings and, being better horsed,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	47	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	Outrode me. After him came spurring hard
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	48	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	49	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	That stopped by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	50	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	He asked the way to Chester, and of him
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	51	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	52	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	He told me that rebellion had bad luck
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	53	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	54	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	With that he gave his able horse the head
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	55	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	And, bending forward, struck his armèd heels
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	56	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	Against the panting sides of his poor jade
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	57	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	58	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	He seemed in running to devour the way,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	59	speech	verse	Travers_2H4	Staying no longer question.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	60	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Ha? Again:
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	61	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	62	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	63	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Had met ill luck?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	64	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	My lord, I’ll tell you what:
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	65	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	If my young lord your son have not the day,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	66	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Upon mine honor, for a silken point
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	67	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	I’ll give my barony. Never talk of it.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	68	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	69	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Give then such instances of loss?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	70	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Who, he?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	71	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	He was some hilding fellow that had stol’n
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	72	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	The horse he rode on and, upon my life,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	73	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Spoke at a venture.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	74	direction	entrance	Morton_2H4	Enter Morton.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	75	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Look, here comes more news.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	76	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title leaf,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	77	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	78	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	79	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Hath left a witnessed usurpation.—
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	80	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	81	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	82	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	83	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	To fright our party.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	84	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	How doth my son and brother?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	85	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	86	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	87	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	88	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	So dull, so dead in look, so woebegone,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	89	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	90	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	91	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	92	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	93	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	This thou wouldst say: “Your son did thus and thus;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	94	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas”—
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	95	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	96	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	97	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	98	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Ending with “Brother, son, and all are dead.”
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	99	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Douglas is living, and your brother yet,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	100	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	But for my lord your son—
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	101	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Why, he is dead.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	102	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	103	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	He that but fears the thing he would not know
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	104	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Hath, by instinct, knowledge from others’ eyes
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	105	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	That what he feared is chancèd. Yet speak, Morton.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	106	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	107	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	108	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	109	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	You are too great to be by me gainsaid,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	110	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	111	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	112	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	I see a strange confession in thine eye.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	113	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Thou shak’st thy head and hold’st it fear or sin
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	114	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	115	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	The tongue offends not that reports his death;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	116	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	117	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Not he which says the dead is not alive.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	118	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	119	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	120	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Sounds ever after as a sullen bell
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	121	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Remembered tolling a departing friend.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	122	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	123	direction	delivery	Morton_2H4	, to Northumberland
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	124	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	I am sorry I should force you to believe
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	125	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	That which I would to God I had not seen,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	126	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	127	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	128	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	129	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	130	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	From whence with life he never more sprung up.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	131	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	132	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	133	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	134	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	From the best-tempered courage in his troops;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	135	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	For from his mettle was his party steeled,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	136	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Which, once in him abated, all the rest
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	137	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Turned on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	138	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	And as the thing that’s heavy in itself
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	139	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	140	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	141	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	142	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	143	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	144	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	145	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	So soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	146	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	147	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Had three times slain th’ appearance of the King,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	148	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	149	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Of those that turned their backs and in his flight,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	150	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	151	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Is that the King hath won and hath sent out
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	152	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	153	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Under the conduct of young Lancaster
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	154	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	155	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	156	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	In poison there is physic, and these news,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	157	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Having been well, that would have made me sick,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	158	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Being sick, have in some measure made me well.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	159	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And as the wretch whose fever-weakened joints,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	160	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	161	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	162	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	163	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Weakened with grief, being now enraged with grief,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	164	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou nice crutch.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	165	direction	business	Northumberland_R2	He throws down his crutch.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	166	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	167	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Must glove this hand. And hence, thou sickly coif.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	168	direction	business	Northumberland_R2	He removes his kerchief.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	169	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	170	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Which princes, fleshed with conquest, aim to hit.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	171	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Now bind my brows with iron, and approach
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	172	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	173	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	To frown upon th’ enraged Northumberland.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	174	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Let heaven kiss Earth! Now let not Nature’s hand
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	175	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Keep the wild flood confined. Let order die,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	176	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And let this world no longer be a stage
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	177	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	To feed contention in a lingering act;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	178	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	179	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	180	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	181	speech	verse	Northumberland_R2	And darkness be the burier of the dead.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	182	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	This strainèd passion doth you wrong, my lord.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	183	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	184	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	The lives of all your loving complices
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	185	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Lean on your health, the which, if you give o’er
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	186	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	187	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	You cast th’ event of war, my noble lord,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	188	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	And summed the accompt of chance before you said
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	189	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	“Let us make head.” It was your presurmise
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	190	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	That in the dole of blows your son might drop.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	191	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	You knew he walked o’er perils on an edge,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	192	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	More likely to fall in than to get o’er.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	193	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	You were advised his flesh was capable
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	194	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	195	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	196	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Yet did you say “Go forth,” and none of this,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	197	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	198	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall’n,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	199	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Or what did this bold enterprise bring forth,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	200	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	More than that being which was like to be?
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	201	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	We all that are engagèd to this loss
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	202	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	203	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	That if we wrought out life, ’twas ten to one;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	204	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	205	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Choked the respect of likely peril feared;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	206	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And since we are o’erset, venture again.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	207	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	208	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	’Tis more than time.—And, my most noble lord,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	209	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	210	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	The gentle Archbishop of York is up
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	211	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	With well-appointed powers. He is a man
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	212	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Who with a double surety binds his followers.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	213	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	My lord your son had only but the corpse,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	214	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	215	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	For that same word “rebellion” did divide
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	216	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	The action of their bodies from their souls,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	217	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	And they did fight with queasiness, constrained,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	218	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	As men drink potions, that their weapons only
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	219	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Seemed on our side. But, for their spirits and souls,
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	220	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	This word “rebellion,” it had froze them up
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	221	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	222	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Turns insurrection to religion.
Henry IV, Part II	1	1	223	speech	verse	Morton_2H4	Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,

Henry IV, Part II	1	2	240	speech	prose	SERVANTS.FALSTAFF.1_2H4	He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but, for the party that owed it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	241	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything that intends to laughter more than I invent, or is invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never manned with an agate till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel. The juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge—I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when He will. ’Tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it, and yet he’ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	242	speech	prose	SERVANTS.FALSTAFF.1_2H4	He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours. He liked not the security.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	243	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Let him be damned like the glutton! Pray God his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel, a rascally yea-forsooth knave, to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security! The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with “security.” I looked he should have sent me two-and-twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me “security.” Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it, and yet cannot he see though he have his own lantern to light him. Where’s Bardolph?
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	244	speech	prose	SERVANTS.FALSTAFF.1_2H4	He’s gone in Smithfield to buy your Worship a horse.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	245	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a horse in Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.

Henry IV, Part II	1	2	265	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Why sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	266	speech	prose	SERVANTS.CHIEFJUSTICE.1_2H4	I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you, you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	267	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which grows to me? If thou gett’st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak’st leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt counter. Hence! Avaunt!
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	268	speech	prose	SERVANTS.CHIEFJUSTICE.1_2H4	Sir, my lord would speak with you.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	269	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	270	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	My good lord. God give your Lordship good time of the day. I am glad to see your Lordship abroad. I heard say your Lordship was sick. I hope your Lordship goes abroad by advice. Your Lordship, though not clean past your youth, have yet some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech your Lordship to have a reverend care of your health.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	271	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	272	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	An ’t please your Lordship, I hear his Majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	273	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	274	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	275	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Well, God mend him. I pray you let me speak with you.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	276	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an ’t please your Lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	277	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	278	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	It hath it original from much grief, from study, and perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen. It is a kind of deafness.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	279	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	280	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, an ’t please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	281	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	282	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your Lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty, but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	283	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	284	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	285	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	286	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	287	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	288	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I would it were otherwise. I would my means were greater and my waist slender.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	289	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	You have misled the youthful prince.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	290	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	The young prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	291	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound. Your day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s exploit on Gad’s Hill. You may thank th’ unquiet time for your quiet o’erposting that action.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	292	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	My lord.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	293	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	But since all is well, keep it so. Wake not a sleeping wolf.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	294	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	295	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	What, you are as a candle, the better part burnt out.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	296	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow. If I did say of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	297	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	There is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravity.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	298	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	299	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	You follow the young prince up and down like his ill angel.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	300	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers’ times that true valor is turned bearherd; pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings. All the other gifts appurtenant to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young. You do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls, and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	301	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	302	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding. And he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him. For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have checked him for it, and the young lion repents. Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	303	direction	delivery	Falstaff_1H4	Aside.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	304	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Well, God send the Prince a better companion.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	305	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	God send the companion a better prince. I cannot rid my hands of him.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	306	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Well, the King hath severed you and Prince Harry. I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	307	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day, for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever. But it was always yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If you will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	308	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Well, be honest, be honest, and God bless your expedition.
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	309	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	Will your Lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth?
Henry IV, Part II	1	2	310	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Not a penny, not a penny. You are too impatient to bear crosses. Fare you well. Commend me to my cousin Westmoreland.

Henry IV, Part II	1	3	342	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	My judgment is we should not step too far
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	343	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Till we had his assistance by the hand.
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	344	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	For in a theme so bloody-faced as this,

Henry IV, Part II	1	3	352	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	353	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	And so, with great imagination

Henry IV, Part II	1	3	360	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Lives so in hope, as in an early spring

Henry IV, Part II	1	3	378	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	We fortify in paper and in figures,
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	379	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Using the names of men instead of men,
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	380	speech	verse	LordBardolph_2H4	Like one that draws the model of an house

Henry IV, Part II	1	3	392	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	393	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Are in three heads: one power against the French,

Henry IV, Part II	1	3	395	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Must take up us. So is the unfirm king
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	396	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	In three divided, and his coffers sound
Henry IV, Part II	1	3	397	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	With hollow poverty and emptiness.

I pray you, since my exion is entered, and my case so openly known to the world, let him be brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed off from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast to bear every knave’s wrong. Yonder he comes, and that arrant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph, with him.

Henry IV, Part II	2	1	472	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home. He hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his. But I will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee o’ nights like the mare.

Henry IV, Part II	2	1	477	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not Goodwife Keech, the butcher’s wife, come in then and call me Gossip Quickly, coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone downstairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it if thou canst.
Henry IV, Part II	2	1	478	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in good case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But, for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.
Henry IV, Part II	2	1	479	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practiced upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.
Henry IV, Part II	2	1	480	speech	prose	MistressQuickly_1H4	Yea, in truth, my lord.
Henry IV, Part II	2	1	481	speech	prose	ChiefJustice_2H4	Pray thee, peace.—Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villainy you have done with her. The one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.
Henry IV, Part II	2	1	482	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honorable boldness “impudent sauciness.” If a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King’s affairs.

Henry IV, Part II	2	2	535	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Before God, I am exceeding weary.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	536	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Is ’t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	537	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	538	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	539	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast—with these, and those that were thy peach-colored ones—or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as, one for superfluity and another for use. But that the tennis-court keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland; and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit His kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	540	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	How ill it follows, after you have labored so hard, you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	541	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	542	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	543	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	544	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Go to. I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	545	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick—albeit I could tell to thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad indeed too.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	546	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Very hardly, upon such a subject.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	547	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	548	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	The reason?
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	549	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	550	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	551	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	It would be every man’s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine. Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	552	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	553	speech	prose	HenryV_H5	And to thee.
Henry IV, Part II	2	2	554	speech	prose	Poins_1H4	By this light, I am well spoke on. I can hear it with mine own ears.

Henry IV, Part II	3	1	957	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Were they at wars. It is but eight years since
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	958	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	959	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Who like a brother toiled in my affairs

Henry IV, Part II	3	1	971	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But that necessity so bowed the state
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	972	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	That I and greatness were compelled to kiss—
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	973	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	“The time shall come,” thus did he follow it,

Henry IV, Part II	3	1	977	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And the division of our amity.
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	978	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	There is a history in all men’s lives

Henry IV, Part II	3	1	982	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	As yet not come to life, who in their seeds

Henry IV, Part II	3	1	984	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Such things become the hatch and brood of time,
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	985	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	And by the necessary form of this,
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	986	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	King Richard might create a perfect guess
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	987	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	That great Northumberland, then false to him,
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	988	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	989	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Which should not find a ground to root upon
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	990	speech	verse	Warwick_2H4	Unless on you.

Henry IV, Part II	3	1	992	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Then let us meet them like necessities.
Henry IV, Part II	3	1	993	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	And that same word even now cries out on us.

Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1018	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	He must then to the Inns o’ Court shortly. I was once of Clement’s Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.

Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1020	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	By the Mass, I was called anything, and I would have done anything indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold man. You had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the Inns o’ Court again. And I may say to you, we knew where the bona robas were and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

I see him break Scoggin’s head at the court gate, when he was a crack not thus high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Grey’s Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I have spent! And to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1023	speech	prose	Silence_2H4	We shall all follow, cousin.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1024	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	Certain, ’tis certain, very sure, very sure. Death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all. All shall die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford Fair?

Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1037	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword man. How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1038	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Sir, pardon. A soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1039	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	It is well said, in faith, sir, and it is well said indeed too. “Better accommodated.” It is good, yea, indeed is it. Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable. “Accommodated.” It comes of accommodo. Very good, a good phrase.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1040	speech	prose	Bardolph_1H4	Pardon, sir, I have heard the word— “phrase” call you it? By this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldierlike word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. “Accommodated,” that is when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be accommodated, which is an excellent thing.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1041	direction	entrance	Falstaff_1H4	Enter Falstaff.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1042	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	It is very just. Look, here comes good Sir John.—Give me your good hand, give me your Worship’s good hand. By my troth, you like well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good Sir John.
Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1043	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow.—Master Sure-card, as I think?

Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1091	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	You may, but if he had been a man’s tailor, he’d ha’ pricked you.—Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat?

Henry IV, Part II	3	2	1117	speech	prose	Shallow_2H4	By the Mass, I could anger her to th’ heart. She was then a bona roba. Doth she hold her own well?

Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here’s Wart. You see what a ragged appearance it is. He shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer’s hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer’s bucket. And this same half-faced fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy. The foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble, the woman’s tailor, run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones.—Put me a caliver into Wart’s hand, Bardolph.

Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying. This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s tribute. I do remember him at Clement’s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese paring. When he was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. He was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible. He was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores called him “mandrake.” He came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and swore they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice’s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John o’ Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I’ll be sworn he ne’er saw him but once in the tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the Marshal’s men. I saw it and told John o’ Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a court. And now has he land and beefs. Well, I’ll be acquainted with him if I return, and ’t shall go hard but I’ll make him a philosopher’s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1192	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	The just proportion that we gave them out.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1193	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Let us sway on and face them in the field.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1194	direction	entrance	Westmoreland_1H4	Enter Westmoreland.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1195	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1196	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1197	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Health and fair greeting from our general,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1198	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1199	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1200	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	What doth concern your coming.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1201	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Then, my lord,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1202	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Unto your Grace do I in chief address
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1203	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1204	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1205	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1206	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And countenanced by boys and beggary—
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1207	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	I say, if damned commotion so appeared
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1208	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	In his true, native, and most proper shape,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1209	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	You, reverend father, and these noble lords
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1210	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Had not been here to dress the ugly form
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1211	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Of base and bloody insurrection
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1212	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1213	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1214	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touched,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1215	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutored,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1216	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whose white investments figure innocence,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1217	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	The dove and very blessèd spirit of peace,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1218	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1219	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1220	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Into the harsh and boist’rous tongue of war,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1221	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1222	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1223	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	To a loud trumpet and a point of war?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1224	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1225	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Briefly, to this end: we are all diseased
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1226	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1227	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1228	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And we must bleed for it; of which disease
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1229	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Our late King Richard, being infected, died.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1230	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1231	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	I take not on me here as a physician,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1232	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Nor do I as an enemy to peace
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1233	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Troop in the throngs of military men,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1234	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	But rather show awhile like fearful war
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1235	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	To diet rank minds sick of happiness
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1236	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1237	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1238	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	I have in equal balance justly weighed
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1239	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1240	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1241	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	We see which way the stream of time doth run
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1242	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And are enforced from our most quiet there
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1243	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	By the rough torrent of occasion,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1244	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And have the summary of all our griefs,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1245	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	When time shall serve, to show in articles;
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1246	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Which long ere this we offered to the King
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1247	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And might by no suit gain our audience.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1248	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1249	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	We are denied access unto his person
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1250	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1251	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	The dangers of the days but newly gone,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1252	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Whose memory is written on the earth
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1253	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	With yet-appearing blood, and the examples
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1254	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Of every minute’s instance, present now,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1255	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1256	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Not to break peace or any branch of it,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1257	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	But to establish here a peace indeed,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1258	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Concurring both in name and quality.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1259	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Whenever yet was your appeal denied?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1260	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Wherein have you been gallèd by the King?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1261	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	What peer hath been suborned to grate on you,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1262	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That you should seal this lawless bloody book
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1263	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1264	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And consecrate commotion’s bitter edge?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1265	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	My brother general, the commonwealth,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1266	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	To brother born an household cruelty,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1267	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	I make my quarrel in particular.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1268	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	There is no need of any such redress,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1269	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1270	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Why not to him in part, and to us all
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1271	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That feel the bruises of the days before
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1272	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	And suffer the condition of these times
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1273	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	To lay a heavy and unequal hand
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1274	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Upon our honors?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1275	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	O, my good Lord Mowbray,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1276	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Construe the times to their necessities,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1277	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And you shall say indeed it is the time,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1278	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And not the King, that doth you injuries.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1279	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Yet for your part, it not appears to me
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1280	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Either from the King or in the present time
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1281	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That you should have an inch of any ground
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1282	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	To build a grief on. Were you not restored
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1283	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	To all the Duke of Norfolk’s seigniories,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1284	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Your noble and right well remembered father’s?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1285	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	What thing, in honor, had my father lost
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1286	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That need to be revived and breathed in me?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1287	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	The King that loved him, as the state stood then,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1288	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Was force perforce compelled to banish him,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1289	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1290	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Being mounted and both rousèd in their seats,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1291	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1292	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Their armèd staves in charge, their beavers down,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1293	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1294	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1295	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Then, then, when there was nothing could have stayed
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1296	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1297	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	O, when the King did throw his warder down—
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1298	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	His own life hung upon the staff he threw—
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1299	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Then threw he down himself and all their lives
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1300	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That by indictment and by dint of sword
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1301	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1302	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1303	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1304	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	In England the most valiant gentleman.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1305	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1306	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	But if your father had been victor there,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1307	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	He ne’er had borne it out of Coventry;
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1308	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	For all the country in a general voice
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1309	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1310	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1311	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And blessed and graced, indeed more than the King.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1312	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	But this is mere digression from my purpose.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1313	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Here come I from our princely general
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1314	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1315	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That he will give you audience; and wherein
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1316	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	It shall appear that your demands are just,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1317	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	You shall enjoy them, everything set off
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1318	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That might so much as think you enemies.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1319	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	But he hath forced us to compel this offer,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1320	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	And it proceeds from policy, not love.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1321	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Mowbray, you overween to take it so.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1322	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1323	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	For, lo, within a ken our army lies,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1324	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Upon mine honor, all too confident
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1325	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	To give admittance to a thought of fear.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1326	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Our battle is more full of names than yours,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1327	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1328	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Our armor all as strong, our cause the best.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1329	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Then reason will our hearts should be as good.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1330	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Say you not then our offer is compelled.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1331	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Well, by my will, we shall admit no parley.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1332	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That argues but the shame of your offense.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1333	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	A rotten case abides no handling.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1334	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Hath the Prince John a full commission,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1335	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	In very ample virtue of his father,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1336	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	To hear and absolutely to determine
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1337	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1338	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	That is intended in the General’s name.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1339	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	I muse you make so slight a question.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1340	direction	business	Archbishop_1H4	, giving Westmoreland a paper
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1340	direction	business	Westmoreland_1H4	, giving Westmoreland a paper
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1341	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1342	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	For this contains our general grievances.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1343	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Each several article herein redressed,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1344	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	All members of our cause, both here and hence
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1345	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	That are insinewed to this action,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1346	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Acquitted by a true substantial form
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1347	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And present execution of our wills
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1348	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	To us and to our purposes confined,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1349	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	We come within our awful banks again
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1350	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1351	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	This will I show the General. Please you, lords,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1352	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	In sight of both our battles we may meet,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1353	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	And either end in peace, which God so frame,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1354	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Or to the place of difference call the swords
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1355	speech	verse	Westmoreland_1H4	Which must decide it.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1356	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	My lord, we will do so.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1357	direction	exit	Westmoreland_1H4	Westmoreland exits.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1358	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	There is a thing within my bosom tells me
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1359	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That no conditions of our peace can stand.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1360	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Fear you not that. If we can make our peace
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1361	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Upon such large terms and so absolute
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1362	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	As our conditions shall consist upon,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1363	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1364	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Yea, but our valuation shall be such
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1365	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That every slight and false-derivèd cause,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1366	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1367	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Shall to the King taste of this action,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1368	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1369	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	We shall be winnowed with so rough a wind
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1370	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1371	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	And good from bad find no partition.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1372	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1373	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Of dainty and such picking grievances,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1374	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	For he hath found to end one doubt by death
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1375	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1376	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1377	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And keep no telltale to his memory
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1378	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	That may repeat and history his loss
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1379	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	To new remembrance. For full well he knows
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1380	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	He cannot so precisely weed this land
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1381	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	As his misdoubts present occasion;
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1382	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	His foes are so enrooted with his friends
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1383	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1384	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	He doth unfasten so and shake a friend;
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1385	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	So that this land, like an offensive wife
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1386	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1387	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	As he is striking holds his infant up
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1388	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And hangs resolved correction in the arm
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1389	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	That was upreared to execution.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1390	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1391	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	On late offenders, that he now doth lack
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1392	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	The very instruments of chastisement,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1393	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1394	speech	verse	Hastings_2H4	May offer but not hold.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1395	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	’Tis very true,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1396	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	And therefore be assured, my good Lord Marshal,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1397	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	If we do now make our atonement well,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1398	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1399	speech	verse	Archbishop_1H4	Grow stronger for the breaking.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1400	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Be it so.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1401	speech	verse	Mowbray_2H4	Here is returned my Lord of Westmoreland.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1402	direction	entrance	Westmoreland_1H4	Enter Westmoreland.
Henry IV, Part II	4	1	1403	direction	delivery	Westmoreland_1H4	, to the Archbishop

Henry IV, Part II	4	2	1606	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	I would you had but the wit; ’twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh. But that’s no marvel; he drinks no wine. There’s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then, when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice. But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage, and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first human principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.

Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1957	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	I met this crown, and I myself know well
Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1958	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	How troublesome it sat upon my head.
Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1959	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1960	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	Better opinion, better confirmation,
Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1961	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	For all the soil of the achievement goes
Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1962	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	With me into the earth. It seemed in me
Henry IV, Part II	4	3	1963	speech	verse	HenryIV_1H4	But as an honor snatched with boist’rous hand,

I have served your Worship truly, sir, this eight years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very little credit with your Worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech you let him be countenanced.

Henry IV, Part II	5	1	2047	speech	prose	Falstaff_1H4	If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits’ staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turned into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another. Therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and he shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders. O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.
