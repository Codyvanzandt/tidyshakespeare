The Winter's Tale	1	1	1	direction	entrance	Archidamus_WT	Enter Camillo and Archidamus.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	2	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	3	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	4	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	Wherein our entertainment shall shame us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed—
The Winter's Tale	1	1	5	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	Beseech you—
The Winter's Tale	1	1	6	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	7	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	8	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	9	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained together in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, hath been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seemed to be together though absent, shook hands as over a vast, and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	10	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	11	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child—one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	12	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	Would they else be content to die?
The Winter's Tale	1	1	13	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	14	speech	prose	Archidamus_WT	If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.
The Winter's Tale	1	1	15	direction	exit	Camillo_WT	They exit.

The Winter's Tale	1	2	17	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been
The Winter's Tale	1	2	18	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne
The Winter's Tale	1	2	19	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Without a burden. Time as long again
The Winter's Tale	1	2	20	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	21	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	And yet we should for perpetuity
The Winter's Tale	1	2	22	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	23	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
The Winter's Tale	1	2	24	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	With one “We thank you” many thousands more
The Winter's Tale	1	2	25	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	That go before it.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	26	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Stay your thanks awhile,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	27	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And pay them when you part.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	28	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Sir, that’s tomorrow.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	29	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I am questioned by my fears of what may chance
The Winter's Tale	1	2	30	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Or breed upon our absence, that may blow
The Winter's Tale	1	2	31	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	No sneaping winds at home to make us say
The Winter's Tale	1	2	32	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stayed
The Winter's Tale	1	2	33	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	To tire your Royalty.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	34	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	We are tougher, brother,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	35	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Than you can put us to ’t.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	36	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	No longer stay.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	37	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	One sev’nnight longer.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	38	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Very sooth, tomorrow.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	39	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	We’ll part the time between ’s, then, and in that
The Winter's Tale	1	2	40	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	I’ll no gainsaying.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	41	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Press me not, beseech you, so.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	42	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	43	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	44	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Were there necessity in your request, although
The Winter's Tale	1	2	45	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
The Winter's Tale	1	2	46	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder
The Winter's Tale	1	2	47	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Were in your love a whip to me, my stay
The Winter's Tale	1	2	48	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	To you a charge and trouble. To save both,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	49	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Farewell, our brother.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	50	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Tongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	51	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
The Winter's Tale	1	2	52	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	53	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure
The Winter's Tale	1	2	54	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	All in Bohemia’s well. This satisfaction
The Winter's Tale	1	2	55	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	The bygone day proclaimed. Say this to him,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	56	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	He’s beat from his best ward.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	57	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Well said, Hermione.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	58	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	To tell he longs to see his son were strong.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	59	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	But let him say so then, and let him go.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	60	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	But let him swear so and he shall not stay;
The Winter's Tale	1	2	61	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	62	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure
The Winter's Tale	1	2	63	direction	delivery	Hermione_WT	To Polixenes.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	64	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
The Winter's Tale	1	2	65	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission
The Winter's Tale	1	2	66	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	To let him there a month behind the gest
The Winter's Tale	1	2	67	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Prefixed for ’s parting.—Yet, good deed, Leontes,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	68	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind
The Winter's Tale	1	2	69	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	What lady she her lord.—You’ll stay?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	70	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	No, madam.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	71	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Nay, but you will?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	72	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I may not, verily.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	73	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Verily?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	74	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You put me off with limber vows. But I,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	75	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	76	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Should yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	77	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You shall not go. A lady’s “verily” is
The Winter's Tale	1	2	78	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	79	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	80	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees
The Winter's Tale	1	2	81	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	When you depart and save your thanks. How say you?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	82	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	My prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,”
The Winter's Tale	1	2	83	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	One of them you shall be.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	84	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Your guest, then, madam.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	85	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	To be your prisoner should import offending,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	86	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Which is for me less easy to commit
The Winter's Tale	1	2	87	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Than you to punish.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	88	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Not your jailer, then,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	89	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you
The Winter's Tale	1	2	90	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	91	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You were pretty lordings then?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	92	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	We were, fair queen,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	93	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Two lads that thought there was no more behind
The Winter's Tale	1	2	94	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	But such a day tomorrow as today,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	95	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	And to be boy eternal.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	96	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Was not my lord
The Winter's Tale	1	2	97	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	The verier wag o’ th’ two?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	98	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun
The Winter's Tale	1	2	99	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	And bleat the one at th’ other. What we changed
The Winter's Tale	1	2	100	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Was innocence for innocence. We knew not
The Winter's Tale	1	2	101	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed
The Winter's Tale	1	2	102	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	That any did. Had we pursued that life,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	103	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	And our weak spirits ne’er been higher reared
The Winter's Tale	1	2	104	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	With stronger blood, we should have answered heaven
The Winter's Tale	1	2	105	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Boldly “Not guilty,” the imposition cleared
The Winter's Tale	1	2	106	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Hereditary ours.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	107	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	By this we gather
The Winter's Tale	1	2	108	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You have tripped since.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	109	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	O my most sacred lady,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	110	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Temptations have since then been born to ’s, for
The Winter's Tale	1	2	111	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
The Winter's Tale	1	2	112	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes
The Winter's Tale	1	2	113	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Of my young playfellow.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	114	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Grace to boot!
The Winter's Tale	1	2	115	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
The Winter's Tale	1	2	116	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	117	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	118	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	If you first sinned with us, and that with us
The Winter's Tale	1	2	119	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You did continue fault, and that you slipped not
The Winter's Tale	1	2	120	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With any but with us.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	121	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Is he won yet?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	122	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	He’ll stay, my lord.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	123	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	At my request he would not.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	124	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st
The Winter's Tale	1	2	125	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To better purpose.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	126	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Never?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	127	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Never but once.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	128	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	What, have I twice said well? When was ’t before?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	129	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s
The Winter's Tale	1	2	130	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless
The Winter's Tale	1	2	131	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	132	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s
The Winter's Tale	1	2	133	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
The Winter's Tale	1	2	134	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:
The Winter's Tale	1	2	135	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	My last good deed was to entreat his stay.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	136	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	What was my first? It has an elder sister,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	137	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!
The Winter's Tale	1	2	138	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	139	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Nay, let me have ’t; I long.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	140	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Why, that was when
The Winter's Tale	1	2	141	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Three crabbèd months had soured themselves to death
The Winter's Tale	1	2	142	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
The Winter's Tale	1	2	143	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
The Winter's Tale	1	2	144	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	“I am yours forever.”
The Winter's Tale	1	2	145	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	’Tis grace indeed.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	146	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	147	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	The one forever earned a royal husband,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	148	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Th’ other for some while a friend.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	149	direction	business	Hermione_WT	She gives Polixenes her hand.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	149	direction	business	Polixenes_WT	She gives Polixenes her hand.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	150	direction	delivery	Leontes_WT	, aside
The Winter's Tale	1	2	151	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Too hot, too hot!
The Winter's Tale	1	2	152	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	153	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	I have tremor cordis on me. My heart dances,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	154	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment
The Winter's Tale	1	2	155	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	May a free face put on, derive a liberty
The Winter's Tale	1	2	156	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	157	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And well become the agent. ’T may, I grant.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	158	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	159	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	As now they are, and making practiced smiles
The Winter's Tale	1	2	160	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere
The Winter's Tale	1	2	161	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	The mort o’ th’ deer—O, that is entertainment
The Winter's Tale	1	2	162	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	My bosom likes not, nor my brows.—Mamillius,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	163	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Art thou my boy?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	164	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Ay, my good lord.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	165	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	I’ fecks!
The Winter's Tale	1	2	166	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy nose?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	167	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	168	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	We must be neat—not neat, but cleanly, captain.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	169	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf
The Winter's Tale	1	2	170	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Are all called neat.—Still virginalling
The Winter's Tale	1	2	171	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	172	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Art thou my calf?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	173	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Yes, if you will, my lord.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	174	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have
The Winter's Tale	1	2	175	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To be full like me; yet they say we are
The Winter's Tale	1	2	176	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	177	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	That will say anything. But were they false
The Winter's Tale	1	2	178	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	As o’erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
The Winter's Tale	1	2	179	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	As dice are to be wished by one that fixes
The Winter's Tale	1	2	180	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true
The Winter's Tale	1	2	181	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	182	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	183	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Most dear’st, my collop! Can thy dam?—may ’t be?—
The Winter's Tale	1	2	184	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Affection, thy intention stabs the center.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	185	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Thou dost make possible things not so held,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	186	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Communicat’st with dreams—how can this be?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	187	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	With what’s unreal thou coactive art,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	188	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent
The Winter's Tale	1	2	189	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	190	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And that beyond commission, and I find it,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	191	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And that to the infection of my brains
The Winter's Tale	1	2	192	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And hard’ning of my brows.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	193	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	What means Sicilia?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	194	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	He something seems unsettled.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	195	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	How, my lord?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	196	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	What cheer? How is ’t with you, best brother?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	197	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You look
The Winter's Tale	1	2	198	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	As if you held a brow of much distraction.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	199	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Are you moved, my lord?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	200	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	No, in good earnest.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	201	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	202	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
The Winter's Tale	1	2	203	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
The Winter's Tale	1	2	204	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil
The Winter's Tale	1	2	205	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	206	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled
The Winter's Tale	1	2	207	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Lest it should bite its master and so prove,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	208	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	209	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	210	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	This squash, this gentleman.—Mine honest friend,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	211	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Will you take eggs for money?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	212	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	No, my lord, I’ll fight.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	213	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole!—My brother,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	214	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Are you so fond of your young prince as we
The Winter's Tale	1	2	215	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Do seem to be of ours?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	216	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	If at home, sir,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	217	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,

The Winter's Tale	1	2	301	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	302	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
The Winter's Tale	1	2	303	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou

The Winter's Tale	1	2	309	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To bide upon ’t: thou art not honest; or,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	310	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	311	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
The Winter's Tale	1	2	312	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	From course required; or else thou must be counted
The Winter's Tale	1	2	313	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	A servant grafted in my serious trust
The Winter's Tale	1	2	314	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And therein negligent; or else a fool
The Winter's Tale	1	2	315	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	That seest a game played home, the rich stake drawn,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	316	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And tak’st it all for jest.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	317	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	My gracious lord,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	318	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	319	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	In every one of these no man is free,

The Winter's Tale	1	2	322	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	323	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	If ever I were willful-negligent,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	324	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	It was my folly; if industriously
The Winter's Tale	1	2	325	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I played the fool, it was my negligence,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	326	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
The Winter's Tale	1	2	327	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To do a thing where I the issue doubted,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	328	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Whereof the execution did cry out
The Winter's Tale	1	2	329	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear
The Winter's Tale	1	2	330	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	331	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Are such allowed infirmities that honesty
The Winter's Tale	1	2	332	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	333	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
The Winter's Tale	1	2	334	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	By its own visage. If I then deny it,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	335	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	’Tis none of mine.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	336	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Ha’ not you seen, Camillo—

The Winter's Tale	1	2	340	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Cannot be mute—or thought—for cogitation
The Winter's Tale	1	2	341	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Resides not in that man that does not think—
The Winter's Tale	1	2	342	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess—
The Winter's Tale	1	2	343	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Or else be impudently negative
The Winter's Tale	1	2	344	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought—then say
The Winter's Tale	1	2	345	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name
The Winter's Tale	1	2	346	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
The Winter's Tale	1	2	347	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Before her troth-plight. Say ’t, and justify ’t.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	348	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I would not be a stander-by to hear
The Winter's Tale	1	2	349	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	My sovereign mistress clouded so without
The Winter's Tale	1	2	350	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	351	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	You never spoke what did become you less
The Winter's Tale	1	2	352	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Than this, which to reiterate were sin
The Winter's Tale	1	2	353	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As deep as that, though true.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	354	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Is whispering nothing?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	355	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	356	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career
The Winter's Tale	1	2	357	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible
The Winter's Tale	1	2	358	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	359	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	360	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes
The Winter's Tale	1	2	361	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	362	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	363	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Why, then the world and all that’s in ’t is nothing,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	364	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	365	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	366	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	If this be nothing.

The Winter's Tale	1	2	371	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	No, no, my lord.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	372	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	It is. You lie, you lie.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	373	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	374	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	375	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Or else a hovering temporizer that

The Winter's Tale	1	2	377	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver

The Winter's Tale	1	2	380	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Who does infect her?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	381	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging
The Winter's Tale	1	2	382	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	About his neck—Bohemia, who, if I
The Winter's Tale	1	2	383	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
The Winter's Tale	1	2	384	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To see alike mine honor as their profits,

The Winter's Tale	1	2	420	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Go then, and with a countenance as clear
The Winter's Tale	1	2	421	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia

The Winter's Tale	1	2	424	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Account me not your servant.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	425	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	This is all.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	426	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Do ’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;

The Winter's Tale	1	2	428	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I’ll do ’t, my lord.

The Winter's Tale	1	2	431	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	O miserable lady! But, for me,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	432	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
The Winter's Tale	1	2	433	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do ’t
The Winter's Tale	1	2	434	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Is the obedience to a master, one
The Winter's Tale	1	2	435	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Who in rebellion with himself will have
The Winter's Tale	1	2	436	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	All that are his so too. To do this deed,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	437	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Promotion follows. If I could find example
The Winter's Tale	1	2	438	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
The Winter's Tale	1	2	439	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	And flourished after, I’d not do ’t. But since

The Winter's Tale	1	2	441	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Let villainy itself forswear ’t. I must
The Winter's Tale	1	2	442	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Forsake the court. To do ’t or no is certain
The Winter's Tale	1	2	443	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To me a breakneck. Happy star reign now!

The Winter's Tale	1	2	450	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Hail, most royal sir.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	451	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	What is the news i’ th’ court?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	452	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	None rare, my lord.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	453	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	The King hath on him such a countenance
The Winter's Tale	1	2	454	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	As he had lost some province and a region
The Winter's Tale	1	2	455	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him
The Winter's Tale	1	2	456	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	With customary compliment, when he,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	457	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary and falling
The Winter's Tale	1	2	458	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and
The Winter's Tale	1	2	459	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	So leaves me to consider what is breeding
The Winter's Tale	1	2	460	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	That changes thus his manners.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	461	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I dare not know, my lord.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	462	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	How, dare not? Do not? Do you know and dare not?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	463	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Be intelligent to me—’tis thereabouts;
The Winter's Tale	1	2	464	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	For to yourself what you do know, you must,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	465	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	466	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
The Winter's Tale	1	2	467	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be
The Winter's Tale	1	2	468	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	A party in this alteration, finding
The Winter's Tale	1	2	469	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Myself thus altered with ’t.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	470	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	There is a sickness
The Winter's Tale	1	2	471	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Which puts some of us in distemper, but
The Winter's Tale	1	2	472	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I cannot name the disease, and it is caught
The Winter's Tale	1	2	473	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Of you that yet are well.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	474	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	How caught of me?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	475	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Make me not sighted like the basilisk.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	476	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I have looked on thousands who have sped the better
The Winter's Tale	1	2	477	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	478	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
The Winter's Tale	1	2	479	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns
The Winter's Tale	1	2	480	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	481	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	482	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	If you know aught which does behoove my knowledge
The Winter's Tale	1	2	483	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Thereof to be informed, imprison ’t not
The Winter's Tale	1	2	484	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	In ignorant concealment.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	485	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I may not answer.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	486	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	487	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	488	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I conjure thee by all the parts of man
The Winter's Tale	1	2	489	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least
The Winter's Tale	1	2	490	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
The Winter's Tale	1	2	491	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	What incidency thou dost guess of harm
The Winter's Tale	1	2	492	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
The Winter's Tale	1	2	493	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Which way to be prevented, if to be;
The Winter's Tale	1	2	494	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	If not, how best to bear it.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	495	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Sir, I will tell you,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	496	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Since I am charged in honor and by him
The Winter's Tale	1	2	497	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	498	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Which must be e’en as swiftly followed as
The Winter's Tale	1	2	499	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
The Winter's Tale	1	2	500	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Cry lost, and so goodnight.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	501	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	On, good Camillo.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	502	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I am appointed him to murder you.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	503	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	By whom, Camillo?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	504	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	By the King.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	505	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	For what?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	506	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	He thinks, nay with all confidence he swears,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	507	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As he had seen ’t or been an instrument
The Winter's Tale	1	2	508	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To vice you to ’t, that you have touched his queen
The Winter's Tale	1	2	509	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Forbiddenly.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	510	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	O, then my best blood turn
The Winter's Tale	1	2	511	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	To an infected jelly, and my name
The Winter's Tale	1	2	512	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
The Winter's Tale	1	2	513	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Turn then my freshest reputation to
The Winter's Tale	1	2	514	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	A savor that may strike the dullest nostril
The Winter's Tale	1	2	515	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	516	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection
The Winter's Tale	1	2	517	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	That e’er was heard or read.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	518	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Swear his thought over
The Winter's Tale	1	2	519	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	By each particular star in heaven and
The Winter's Tale	1	2	520	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	By all their influences, you may as well
The Winter's Tale	1	2	521	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
The Winter's Tale	1	2	522	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The Winter's Tale	1	2	523	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
The Winter's Tale	1	2	524	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The Winter's Tale	1	2	525	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	The standing of his body.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	526	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	How should this grow?
The Winter's Tale	1	2	527	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I know not. But I am sure ’tis safer to
The Winter's Tale	1	2	528	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	529	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	530	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	That lies enclosèd in this trunk which you
The Winter's Tale	1	2	531	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Shall bear along impawned, away tonight!
The Winter's Tale	1	2	532	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Your followers I will whisper to the business,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	533	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	And will by twos and threes at several posterns
The Winter's Tale	1	2	534	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put
The Winter's Tale	1	2	535	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	My fortunes to your service, which are here
The Winter's Tale	1	2	536	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	537	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	For, by the honor of my parents, I
The Winter's Tale	1	2	538	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Have uttered truth—which if you seek to prove,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	539	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
The Winter's Tale	1	2	540	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Than one condemned by the King’s own mouth, thereon
The Winter's Tale	1	2	541	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	His execution sworn.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	542	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I do believe thee.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	543	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	544	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Be pilot to me and thy places shall
The Winter's Tale	1	2	545	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and
The Winter's Tale	1	2	546	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	My people did expect my hence departure
The Winter's Tale	1	2	547	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Two days ago. This jealousy
The Winter's Tale	1	2	548	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Is for a precious creature. As she’s rare,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	549	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	550	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Must it be violent; and as he does conceive
The Winter's Tale	1	2	551	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	He is dishonored by a man which ever
The Winter's Tale	1	2	552	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Professed to him, why, his revenges must
The Winter's Tale	1	2	553	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	554	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
The Winter's Tale	1	2	555	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
The Winter's Tale	1	2	556	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Of his ill-ta’en suspicion. Come, Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	1	2	557	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	I will respect thee as a father if
The Winter's Tale	1	2	558	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.
The Winter's Tale	1	2	559	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	It is in mine authority to command
The Winter's Tale	1	2	560	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness

The Winter's Tale	2	1	566	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	Come, my gracious lord,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	567	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	Shall I be your playfellow?
The Winter's Tale	2	1	568	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	No, I’ll none of you.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	569	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	Why, my sweet lord?
The Winter's Tale	2	1	570	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
The Winter's Tale	2	1	571	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	I were a baby still.—I love you better.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	572	speech	verse	LADIES.0.2_WT	And why so, my lord?
The Winter's Tale	2	1	573	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Not for because
The Winter's Tale	2	1	574	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Your brows are blacker—yet black brows, they say,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	575	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Become some women best, so that there be not
The Winter's Tale	2	1	576	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	577	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Or a half-moon made with a pen.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	578	speech	verse	LADIES.0.2_WT	Who taught this?
The Winter's Tale	2	1	579	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	I learned it out of women’s faces.—Pray now,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	580	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	What color are your eyebrows?
The Winter's Tale	2	1	581	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	Blue, my lord.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	582	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose
The Winter's Tale	2	1	583	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	584	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	Hark ye,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	585	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall
The Winter's Tale	2	1	586	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	Present our services to a fine new prince
The Winter's Tale	2	1	587	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us
The Winter's Tale	2	1	588	speech	verse	LADIES.0.1_WT	If we would have you.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	589	speech	verse	LADIES.0.2_WT	She is spread of late
The Winter's Tale	2	1	590	speech	verse	LADIES.0.2_WT	Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!
The Winter's Tale	2	1	591	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	What wisdom stirs amongst you?—Come, sir, now
The Winter's Tale	2	1	592	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	593	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	And tell ’s a tale.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	594	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	Merry or sad shall ’t be?
The Winter's Tale	2	1	595	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	As merry as you will.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	596	speech	verse	Mamillius_WT	A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one

The Winter's Tale	2	1	610	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.0.1_WT	Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them
The Winter's Tale	2	1	611	speech	verse	ATTENDANTS.0.1_WT	Even to their ships.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	612	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	How blest am I
The Winter's Tale	2	1	613	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	In my just censure, in my true opinion!
The Winter's Tale	2	1	614	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed
The Winter's Tale	2	1	615	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	In being so blest! There may be in the cup

The Winter's Tale	2	1	617	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge

The Winter's Tale	2	1	620	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,

The Winter's Tale	2	1	626	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	He has discovered my design, and I
The Winter's Tale	2	1	627	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick
The Winter's Tale	2	1	628	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	For them to play at will. How came the posterns

The Winter's Tale	2	1	649	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	You, my lords,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	650	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Look on her, mark her well. Be but about
The Winter's Tale	2	1	651	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	To say “She is a goodly lady,” and
The Winter's Tale	2	1	652	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	The justice of your hearts will thereto add
The Winter's Tale	2	1	653	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	“’Tis pity she’s not honest, honorable.”
The Winter's Tale	2	1	654	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Praise her but for this her without-door form,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	655	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight

The Winter's Tale	2	1	660	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	When you have said she’s goodly, come between
The Winter's Tale	2	1	661	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Ere you can say she’s honest. But be ’t known,

The Winter's Tale	2	1	665	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	The most replenished villain in the world,

The Winter's Tale	2	1	668	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	You have mistook, my lady,

The Winter's Tale	2	1	673	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	And mannerly distinguishment leave out
The Winter's Tale	2	1	674	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Betwixt the prince and beggar.—I have said
The Winter's Tale	2	1	675	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	She’s an adult’ress; I have said with whom.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	676	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	More, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is
The Winter's Tale	2	1	677	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	A federary with her, and one that knows
The Winter's Tale	2	1	678	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	What she should shame to know herself

The Winter's Tale	2	1	683	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	No, by my life,

The Winter's Tale	2	1	685	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
The Winter's Tale	2	1	686	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You thus have published me! Gentle my lord,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	687	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You scarce can right me throughly then to say
The Winter's Tale	2	1	688	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You did mistake.

The Winter's Tale	2	1	693	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
The Winter's Tale	2	1	694	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	But that he speaks.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	695	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	There’s some ill planet reigns.
The Winter's Tale	2	1	696	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I must be patient till the heavens look
The Winter's Tale	2	1	697	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,

The Winter's Tale	2	1	701	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	That honorable grief lodged here which burns
The Winter's Tale	2	1	702	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,
The Winter's Tale	2	1	703	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With thoughts so qualified as your charities
The Winter's Tale	2	1	704	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so

The Winter's Tale	2	1	706	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Shall I be heard?

The Winter's Tale	2	1	708	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	My women may be with me, for you see
The Winter's Tale	2	1	709	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	My plight requires it.—Do not weep, good fools;
The Winter's Tale	2	1	710	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	There is no cause. When you shall know your mistress

The Winter's Tale	2	1	737	speech	verse	Antigonus_WT	You are abused, and by some putter-on
The Winter's Tale	2	1	738	speech	verse	Antigonus_WT	That will be damned for ’t. Would I knew the villain!
The Winter's Tale	2	1	739	speech	verse	Antigonus_WT	I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flawed,

The Winter's Tale	3	2	1224	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	How merited to be so; since he came,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1225	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With what encounter so uncurrent I
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1226	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Have strained t’ appear thus; if one jot beyond

The Winter's Tale	3	2	1228	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	That way inclining, hardened be the hearts

The Winter's Tale	3	2	1231	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	I ne’er heard yet
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1232	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	That any of these bolder vices wanted
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1233	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Less impudence to gainsay what they did
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1234	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Than to perform it first.
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1235	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	That’s true enough,

The Winter's Tale	3	2	1239	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1240	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1241	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With whom I am accused, I do confess
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1242	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I loved him as in honor he required,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1243	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	With such a kind of love as might become
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1244	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	A lady like me, with a love even such,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1245	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	So and no other, as yourself commanded,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1246	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Which not to have done, I think, had been in me
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1247	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Both disobedience and ingratitude
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1248	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1249	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1250	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1251	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	I know not how it tastes, though it be dished
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1252	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	For me to try how. All I know of it
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1253	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Is that Camillo was an honest man;
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1254	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1255	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1256	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	You knew of his departure, as you know
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1257	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1258	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Sir,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1259	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	You speak a language that I understand not.
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1260	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	My life stands in the level of your dreams,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1261	speech	verse	Hermione_WT	Which I’ll lay down.
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1262	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Your actions are my dreams.
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1263	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	You had a bastard by Polixenes,

The Winter's Tale	3	2	1265	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Those of your fact are so—so past all truth,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1266	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1267	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
The Winter's Tale	3	2	1268	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	No father owning it—which is indeed

The Winter's Tale	3	2	1271	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	Look for no less than death.

The Winter's Tale	4	2	1573	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	It is fifteen years since I saw my country. Though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay—or I o’erween to think so—which is another spur to my departure.
The Winter's Tale	4	2	1574	speech	prose	Polixenes_WT	As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered, as too much I cannot, to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawst thou the Prince Florizell, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.
The Winter's Tale	4	2	1575	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown, but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
The Winter's Tale	4	2	1576	speech	prose	Polixenes_WT	I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness, from whom I have this intelligence: that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
The Winter's Tale	4	2	1577	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
The Winter's Tale	4	2	1578	speech	prose	Polixenes_WT	That’s likewise part of my intelligence, but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
The Winter's Tale	4	2	1579	speech	prose	Camillo_WT	I willingly obey your command.

She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song men all, and very good ones; but they are most of them means and basses, but one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have saffron to color the warden pies; mace; dates, none, that’s out of my note; nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun.

The Winter's Tale	4	3	1632	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of the Prince. I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
The Winter's Tale	4	3	1633	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	His vices, you would say. There’s no virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to make it stay there, and yet it will no more but abide.
The Winter's Tale	4	3	1634	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an ape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s wife within a mile where my land and living lies, and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1748	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1750	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	Which some call nature’s bastards. Of that kind
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1751	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1752	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	To get slips of them.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1753	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Wherefore, gentle maiden,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1754	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Do you neglect them?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1755	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	For I have heard it said

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1760	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	But nature makes that mean. So, over that art
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1761	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Which you say adds to nature is an art
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1762	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1763	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	A gentler scion to the wildest stock,

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1766	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1767	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	The art itself is nature.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1768	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	So it is.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1769	speech	verse	Polixenes_WT	Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1780	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1781	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1796	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1797	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1798	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,

The Winter's Tale	4	4	1859	speech	verse	Shepherd_WT	He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1860	speech	verse	Shepherd_WT	I think so too, for never gazed the moon

He sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s ears grew to his tunes.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1872	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	He could never come better. He shall come in. I love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	1873	speech	prose	SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes. No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love songs for maids, so without bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings, “Jump her and thump her.” And where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer “Whoop, do me no harm, good man”; puts him off, slights him, with “Whoop, do me no harm, good man.”

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2172	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	With her who here I cannot hold on shore.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2195	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Sir, I think

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2197	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	That I have borne your father?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2198	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Very nobly
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2199	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Have you deserved. It is my father’s music
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2200	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	To speak your deeds, not little of his care
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2201	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	To have them recompensed as thought on.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2202	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Well, my lord,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2203	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	If you may please to think I love the King

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2206	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	If your more ponderous and settled project
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2207	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	May suffer alteration. On mine honor,

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2209	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As shall become your Highness, where you may
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2210	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Enjoy your mistress—from the whom I see
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2211	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	There’s no disjunction to be made but by,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2212	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As heavens forfend, your ruin—marry her,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2213	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	And with my best endeavors in your absence,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2214	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Your discontenting father strive to qualify
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2215	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	And bring him up to liking.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2216	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	How, Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2217	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	May this, almost a miracle, be done,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2218	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	That I may call thee something more than man,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2219	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	And after that trust to thee?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2220	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Have you thought on
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2221	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	A place whereto you’ll go?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2222	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Not any yet.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2223	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	But as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2224	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	To what we wildly do, so we profess
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2225	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2226	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Of every wind that blows.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2227	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Then list to me.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2228	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	This follows: if you will not change your purpose
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2229	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2230	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	And there present yourself and your fair princess,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2231	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2232	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	She shall be habited as it becomes
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2233	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2234	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2235	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	His welcomes forth, asks thee, the son, forgiveness,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2236	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2237	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2238	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2239	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	He chides to hell and bids the other grow
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2240	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Faster than thought or time.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2241	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Worthy Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2242	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	What color for my visitation shall I
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2243	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Hold up before him?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2244	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Sent by the King your father
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2245	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2246	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	The manner of your bearing towards him, with
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2247	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	What you, as from your father, shall deliver,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2248	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2249	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	The which shall point you forth at every sitting
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2250	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	What you must say, that he shall not perceive
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2251	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	But that you have your father’s bosom there
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2252	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	And speak his very heart.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2253	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	I am bound to you.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2254	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	There is some sap in this.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2255	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	A course more promising
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2256	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Than a wild dedication of yourselves
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2257	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To unpathed waters, undreamed shores, most certain
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2258	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2259	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	But as you shake off one to take another;
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2260	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2261	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Do their best office if they can but stay you
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2262	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2263	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Prosperity’s the very bond of love,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2264	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2265	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Affliction alters.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2266	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	One of these is true.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2267	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	I think affliction may subdue the cheek
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2268	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	But not take in the mind.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2269	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Yea, say you so?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2270	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	There shall not at your father’s house these seven years
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2271	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Be born another such.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2272	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	My good Camillo,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2273	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	She’s as forward of her breeding as she is
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2274	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	I’ th’ rear our birth.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2275	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	I cannot say ’tis pity
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2276	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2277	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	To most that teach.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2278	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	Your pardon, sir. For this
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2279	speech	verse	Perdita_WT	I’ll blush you thanks.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2280	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	My prettiest Perdita.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2284	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	We are not furnished like Bohemia’s son,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2285	speech	verse	Florizell_WT	Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2286	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	My lord,
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2287	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2288	speech	verse	Camillo_WT	Do all lie there. It shall be so my care

Not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe tie, bracelet, horn ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and what I saw, to my good use I remembered. My clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinched a placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse. I could have filed keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses. And had not the old man come in with a hubbub against his daughter and the King’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2354	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	I understand the business; I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand is necessary for a cutpurse; a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for th’ other senses. I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels. If I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the King withal, I would not do ’t. I hold it the more knavery to conceal it, and therein am I constant to my profession.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2361	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Nay, but hear me!

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2363	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the King, and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show those things you found about her, those secret things, all but what she has with her. This being done, let the law go whistle, I warrant you.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2364	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	I will tell the King all, every word, yea, and his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make me the King’s brother-in-law.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2365	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him, and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2378	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	We are but plain fellows, sir.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2379	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie, but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore they do not give us the lie.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2380	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Your Worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2381	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2382	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? Hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? Receives not thy nose court odor from me? Reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt? Think’st thou, for that I insinuate and toze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier cap-a-pie; and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there. Whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2383	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	My business, sir, is to the King.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2391	speech	verse	Autolycus_WT	Yet Nature might have made me as these are.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2396	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical. A great man, I’ll warrant. I know by the picking on ’s teeth.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2397	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	The fardel there. What’s i’ th’ fardel? Wherefore that box?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2398	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the King, and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to th’ speech of him.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2399	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	Age, thou hast lost thy labor.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2400	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	Why, sir?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2401	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	The King is not at the palace. He is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself, for, if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must know the King is full of grief.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2402	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	So ’tis said, sir—about his son, that should have married a shepherd’s daughter.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2403	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	If that shepherd be not in handfast, let him fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2404	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Think you so, sir?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2405	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall all come under the hangman—which, though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned, but that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheepcote? All deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2406	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, an ’t like you, sir?
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2407	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then ’nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasps’-nest; then stand till he be three-quarters and a dram dead, then recovered again with aqua vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at, their offenses being so capital? Tell me—for you seem to be honest plain men—what you have to the King. Being something gently considered, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2409	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	He seems to be of great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember: “stoned,” and “flayed alive.”

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2413	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	Ay, sir.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2414	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	Well, give me the moiety.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2417	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	In some sort, sir; but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2418	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son! Hang him, he’ll be made an example.

We are gone else.—Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be brought you.
The Winter's Tale	4	4	2421	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	I will trust you. Walk before toward the seaside. Go on the right hand. I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.

The Winter's Tale	4	4	2426	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me. She drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion: gold, and a means to do the Prince my master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious, for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to ’t.

The Winter's Tale	5	1	2540	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
The Winter's Tale	5	1	2541	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	’Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
The Winter's Tale	5	1	2542	speech	verse	Leontes_WT	By need and accident. What train?
The Winter's Tale	5	1	2543	speech	verse	SERVANTS.X.3_WT	But few,

The Winter's Tale	5	2	2718	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it, whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber. Only this, methought, I heard the shepherd say: he found the child.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2719	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	I would most gladly know the issue of it.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2720	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	I make a broken delivery of the business, but the changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture. They looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared in them, but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it must needs be.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2721	direction	entrance	ATTENDANTS.2_WT	Enter another Gentleman.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2722	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.— The news, Rogero?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2723	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_WT	Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfilled: the King’s daughter is found! Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad makers cannot be able to express it.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2724	direction	entrance	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	Enter another Gentleman.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2725	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_WT	Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward. He can deliver you more.—How goes it now, sir? This news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2726	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character, the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the King’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2727	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_WT	No.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2728	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries “O, thy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2729	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_WT	What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2730	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2731	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	What became of his bark and his followers?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2732	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	Wracked the same instant of their master’s death and in the view of the shepherd, so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina. She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2733	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2734	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes—caught the water, though not the fish—was when at the relation of the Queen’s death—with the manner how she came to ’t bravely confessed and lamented by the King—how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till, from one sign of dolor to another, she did, with an “Alas,” I would fain say bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed color; some swooned, all sorrowed. If all the world could have seen ’t, the woe had been universal.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2735	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	Are they returned to the court?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2736	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.3_WT	No. The Princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina—a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape; he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2737	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.2_WT	I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2738	speech	prose	ATTENDANTS.1_WT	Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let’s along.

The Winter's Tale	5	2	2740	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince, told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what. But he at that time, overfond of the shepherd’s daughter—so he then took her to be— who began to be much seasick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscovered. But ’tis all one to me, for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relished among my other discredits.

The Winter's Tale	5	2	2745	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2746	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2747	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2748	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	And so have I, boy.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2749	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	So you have—but I was a gentleman born before my father. For the King’s son took me by the hand and called me brother, and then the two kings called my father brother, and then the Prince my brother and the Princess my sister called my father father; and so we wept, and there was the first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2750	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	We may live, son, to shed many more.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2751	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Ay, or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.

The Winter's Tale	5	2	2758	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	You may say it, but not swear it.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2759	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it; I’ll swear it.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2760	speech	prose	Shepherd_WT	How if it be false, son?
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2761	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend.—And I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk. But I’ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2762	speech	prose	Autolycus_WT	I will prove so, sir, to my power.
The Winter's Tale	5	2	2763	speech	prose	ShepherdsSon_WT	Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not.

The Winter's Tale	5	3	2782	speech	verse	Paulina_WT	As she lived peerless,
