Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	40	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	But there are other strict observances:
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	41	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	As not to see a woman in that term,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	42	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Which I hope well is not enrollèd there;
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	43	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And one day in a week to touch no food,

Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	45	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	The which I hope is not enrollèd there;
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	46	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And then to sleep but three hours in the night,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	47	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And not be seen to wink of all the day—
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	48	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	When I was wont to think no harm all night,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	49	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And make a dark night too of half the day—
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	50	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Which I hope well is not enrollèd there.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	51	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	52	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	53	speech	verse	King_LLL	Your oath is passed to pass away from these.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	54	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Let me say no, my liege, an if you please.

Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	58	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	By yea and nay, sir. Then I swore in jest.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	59	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	What is the end of study, let me know?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	60	speech	verse	King_LLL	Why, that to know which else we should not know.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	61	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	62	speech	verse	King_LLL	Ay, that is study’s godlike recompense.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	63	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Come on, then, I will swear to study so,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	64	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	To know the thing I am forbid to know:
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	65	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	As thus—to study where I well may dine,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	66	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	67	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Or study where to meet some mistress fine
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	68	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	69	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Or having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	70	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Study to break it, and not break my troth.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	71	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	If study’s gain be thus, and this be so,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	72	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	73	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	74	speech	verse	King_LLL	These be the stops that hinder study quite,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	75	speech	verse	King_LLL	And train our intellects to vain delight.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	76	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Why, all delights are vain, and that most vain
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	77	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	78	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	As painfully to pore upon a book
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	79	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	To seek the light of truth, while truth the while
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	80	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	81	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Light seeking light doth light of light beguile.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	82	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	83	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	84	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Study me how to please the eye indeed
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	85	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	86	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	87	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And give him light that it was blinded by.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	88	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	89	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	90	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Small have continual plodders ever won,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	91	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Save base authority from others’ books.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	92	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	93	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	That give a name to every fixèd star,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	94	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Have no more profit of their shining nights
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	95	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	96	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Too much to know is to know naught but fame,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	97	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And every godfather can give a name.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	98	speech	verse	King_LLL	How well he’s read to reason against reading.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	99	speech	verse	Dumaine_LLL	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	100	speech	verse	Longaville_LLL	He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	101	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	102	speech	verse	Dumaine_LLL	How follows that?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	103	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Fit in his place and time.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	104	speech	verse	Dumaine_LLL	In reason nothing.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	105	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Something then in rhyme.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	106	speech	verse	King_LLL	Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	107	speech	verse	King_LLL	That bites the firstborn infants of the spring.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	108	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Well, say I am. Why should proud summer boast
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	109	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	110	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	111	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	112	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	113	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	But like of each thing that in season grows.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	114	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	So you, to study now it is too late,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	115	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	116	speech	verse	King_LLL	Well, sit you out. Go home, Berowne. Adieu.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	117	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	118	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	119	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	120	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Yet, confident, I’ll keep what I have sworn
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	121	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And bide the penance of each three years’ day.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	122	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Give me the paper. Let me read the same,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	123	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.

Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	132	speech	verse	Longaville_LLL	To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	133	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	A dangerous law against gentility.

Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	141	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Therefore this article is made in vain,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	142	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Or vainly comes th’ admirèd princess hither.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	143	speech	verse	King_LLL	What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	144	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	So study evermore is overshot.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	145	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	While it doth study to have what it would,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	146	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	It doth forget to do the thing it should.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	147	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	148	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	’Tis won as towns with fire—so won, so lost.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	149	speech	verse	King_LLL	We must of force dispense with this decree.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	150	speech	verse	King_LLL	She must lie here on mere necessity.

Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	154	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Not by might mastered, but by special grace.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	155	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	156	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	I am forsworn on mere necessity.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	157	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	So to the laws at large I write my name,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	158	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And he that breaks them in the least degree
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	159	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	160	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Suggestions are to other as to me,

Love's Labor's Lost	1	1	170	speech	verse	King_LLL	Doth ravish like enchanting harmony,

Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	286	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	I confess both. They are both the varnish of a complete man.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	287	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.

Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	295	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humor of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take desire prisoner and ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What great men have been in love?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	296	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	Hercules, master.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	297	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	298	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter, and he was in love.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	299	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	O, well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson; I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson’s love, my dear Mote?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	300	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	A woman, master.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	301	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Of what complexion?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	302	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	303	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Tell me precisely of what complexion.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	304	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	Of the sea-water green, sir.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	305	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Is that one of the four complexions?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	306	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	307	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Green indeed is the color of lovers. But to have a love of that color, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	308	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	309	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	My love is most immaculate white and red.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	310	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colors.

Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	315	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	Her faults will ne’er be known,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	316	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	317	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	And fears by pale white shown.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	318	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	Then if she fear, or be to blame,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	319	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	By this you shall not know,
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	320	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	For still her cheeks possess the same
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	321	speech	verse	Boy_LLL	Which native she doth owe.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	322	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	323	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Is there not a ballad, boy, of The King and the Beggar?
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	324	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.
Love's Labor's Lost	1	2	325	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well.

I shall be forsworn (which is a great argument of falsehood) if I love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; love is a devil. There is no evil angel but love, yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello he regards not. His disgrace is to be called “boy,” but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valor; rust, rapier; be still, drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1388	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	In leaden contemplation have found out
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1389	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1390	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Of beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1391	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Other slow arts entirely keep the brain
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1392	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And therefore, finding barren practicers,
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1393	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1394	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	But love, first learnèd in a lady’s eyes,
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1395	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Lives not alone immurèd in the brain,
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1396	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	But with the motion of all elements

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1398	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And gives to every power a double power,
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1399	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Above their functions and their offices.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1400	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	It adds a precious seeing to the eye.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1401	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1402	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1404	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1405	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1406	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1430	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	It is religion to be thus forsworn,
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1431	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	For charity itself fulfills the law,
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1432	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And who can sever love from charity?
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1433	speech	verse	King_LLL	Saint Cupid, then, and, soldiers, to the field!

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1438	speech	verse	Longaville_LLL	Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1439	speech	verse	King_LLL	And win them, too. Therefore let us devise
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1440	speech	verse	King_LLL	Some entertainment for them in their tents.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1441	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	First, from the park let us conduct them thither.

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1445	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Such as the shortness of the time can shape;

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1447	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Forerun fair love, strewing her way with flowers.
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1448	speech	verse	King_LLL	Away, away! No time shall be omitted
Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1449	speech	verse	King_LLL	That will betime and may by us be fitted.

Love's Labor's Lost	4	3	1452	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;

Your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious, pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the King’s, who is intituled, nominated, or called Don Adriano de Armado.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1458	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	Novi hominem tanquam te. His humor is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1459	speech	prose	Nathaniel_LLL	A most singular and choice epithet.

Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1461	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography, as to speak “dout,” fine, when he should say “doubt”; “det” when he should pronounce “debt”—d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. He clepeth a calf “cauf,” half “hauf,” neighbor vocatur “nebor”; neigh abbreviated ne. This is abhominable—which he would call “abominable.” It insinuateth me of insanie. Ne intelligis, domine? To make frantic, lunatic.

Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1499	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Sir, it is the King’s most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the Princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the rude multitude call the afternoon.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1500	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	“The posterior of the day,” most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for “the afternoon”; the word is well culled, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1501	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure you, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee apparel thy head. And among other important and most serious designs, and of great import indeed, too— but let that pass; for I must tell thee, it will please his Grace, by the world, sometimes to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio—but, sweetheart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable! Some certain special honors it pleaseth his Greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world—but let that pass. The very all of all is—but sweetheart, I do implore secrecy—that the King would have me present the Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal to the end to crave your assistance.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1502	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.—Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by our assistance, the King’s command, and this most gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess—I say, none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1503	speech	prose	Nathaniel_LLL	Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1504	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	Joshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus. This swain, because of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules—
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1505	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	Pardon, sir—error. He is not quantity enough for that Worthy’s thumb; he is not so big as the end of his club!
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1506	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority. His enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1507	speech	prose	Boy_LLL	An excellent device. So, if any of the audience hiss, you may cry “Well done, Hercules, now thou crushest the snake.” That is the way to make an offense gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1508	speech	prose	Armado_LLL	For the rest of the Worthies?
Love's Labor's Lost	5	1	1509	speech	prose	Holofernes_LLL	I will play three myself.

Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2341	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false

Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2344	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2345	speech	verse	Berowne_LLL	Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2350	speech	verse	Princess_LLL	As bombast and as lining to the time.

Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2364	speech	verse	Princess_LLL	You will do aught, this shall you do for me:

Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2382	speech	verse	Princess_LLL	For the remembrance of my father’s death.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2383	speech	verse	Princess_LLL	If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2384	speech	verse	Princess_LLL	Neither entitled in the other’s heart.
Love's Labor's Lost	5	2	2385	speech	verse	King_LLL	If this, or more than this, I would deny,
