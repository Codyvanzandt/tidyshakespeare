Titus Andronicus	2	1	568	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	569	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
Titus Andronicus	2	1	570	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And overlooks the highest-peering hills,

Titus Andronicus	2	1	572	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	573	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.

Titus Andronicus	2	1	605	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?

Titus Andronicus	2	1	607	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Till you know better how to handle it.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	608	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,

Titus Andronicus	2	1	612	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Why, how now, lords?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	613	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	So near the Emperor’s palace dare you draw
Titus Andronicus	2	1	614	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And maintain such a quarrel openly?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	615	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	616	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	I would not for a million of gold
Titus Andronicus	2	1	617	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	The cause were known to them it most concerns,

Titus Andronicus	2	1	620	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	For shame, put up.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	621	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Not I, till I have sheathed
Titus Andronicus	2	1	622	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	My rapier in his bosom, and withal
Titus Andronicus	2	1	623	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
Titus Andronicus	2	1	624	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	That he hath breathed in my dishonor here.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	625	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	For that I am prepared and full resolved,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	626	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	Foul-spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue

Titus Andronicus	2	1	628	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Away, I say!
Titus Andronicus	2	1	629	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	630	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	This petty brabble will undo us all.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	631	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
Titus Andronicus	2	1	632	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	It is to jet upon a prince’s right?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	633	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	What, is Lavinia then become so loose
Titus Andronicus	2	1	634	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Or Bassianus so degenerate
Titus Andronicus	2	1	635	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	That for her love such quarrels may be broached
Titus Andronicus	2	1	636	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	637	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Young lords, beware! And should the Empress know
Titus Andronicus	2	1	638	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	This discord’s ground, the music would not please.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	639	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	I care not, I, knew she and all the world.

Titus Andronicus	2	1	641	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	642	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Lavinia is thine elder brother’s hope.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	643	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Why, are you mad? Or know you not in Rome
Titus Andronicus	2	1	644	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	How furious and impatient they be,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	645	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And cannot brook competitors in love?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	646	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
Titus Andronicus	2	1	647	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	By this device.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	648	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	Aaron, a thousand deaths
Titus Andronicus	2	1	649	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	650	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	To achieve her how?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	651	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Why makes thou it so strange?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	652	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	She is a woman, therefore may be wooed;
Titus Andronicus	2	1	653	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	She is a woman, therefore may be won;
Titus Andronicus	2	1	654	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	655	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	What, man, more water glideth by the mill
Titus Andronicus	2	1	656	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Than wots the miller of, and easy it is
Titus Andronicus	2	1	657	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	658	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Though Bassianus be the Emperor’s brother,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	659	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Better than he have worn Vulcan’s badge.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	660	direction	delivery	Aaron_Tit	, aside
Titus Andronicus	2	1	661	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	662	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Then why should he despair that knows to court it
Titus Andronicus	2	1	663	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	With words, fair looks, and liberality?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	664	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	What, hast not thou full often struck a doe
Titus Andronicus	2	1	665	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	And borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	666	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so
Titus Andronicus	2	1	667	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Would serve your turns.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	668	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	Ay, so the turn were served.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	669	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Aaron, thou hast hit it.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	670	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Would you had hit it too!
Titus Andronicus	2	1	671	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Then should not we be tired with this ado.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	672	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Why, hark you, hark you! And are you such fools
Titus Andronicus	2	1	673	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	To square for this? Would it offend you then
Titus Andronicus	2	1	674	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	That both should speed?
Titus Andronicus	2	1	675	speech	verse	Chiron_Tit	Faith, not me.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	676	speech	verse	Demetrius_Tit	Nor me, so I were one.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	677	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	678	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	’Tis policy and stratagem must do
Titus Andronicus	2	1	679	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	That you affect, and so must you resolve
Titus Andronicus	2	1	680	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	That what you cannot as you would achieve,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	681	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	You must perforce accomplish as you may.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	682	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
Titus Andronicus	2	1	683	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Than this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	684	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	A speedier course than ling’ring languishment
Titus Andronicus	2	1	685	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	686	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
Titus Andronicus	2	1	687	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	There will the lovely Roman ladies troop.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	688	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	The forest walks are wide and spacious,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	689	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And many unfrequented plots there are,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	690	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	691	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Single you thither then this dainty doe,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	692	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And strike her home by force, if not by words.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	693	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
Titus Andronicus	2	1	694	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit

Titus Andronicus	2	1	698	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
Titus Andronicus	2	1	699	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	But to your wishes’ height advance you both.

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1206	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1207	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1208	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1209	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	But me and mine. How happy art thou then

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1220	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.—

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1227	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Give me a sword. I’ll chop off my hands too,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1228	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	For they have fought for Rome and all in vain;
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1229	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	And they have nursed this woe in feeding life;
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1230	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	In bootless prayer have they been held up,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1231	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	And they have served me to effectless use.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1232	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Now all the service I require of them
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1233	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Is that the one will help to cut the other.—
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1234	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1235	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	For hands to do Rome service is but vain.

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1239	speech	verse	Marcus_Tit	Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1242	speech	verse	Lucius_Tit	O, say thou for her who hath done this deed!
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1243	speech	verse	Marcus_Tit	O, thus I found her straying in the park,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1244	speech	verse	Marcus_Tit	Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1245	speech	verse	Marcus_Tit	That hath received some unrecuring wound.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1246	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	It was my dear, and he that wounded her
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1247	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1248	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	For now I stand as one upon a rock,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1249	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Environed with a wilderness of sea,

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1251	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Expecting ever when some envious surge
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1252	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1253	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	This way to death my wretched sons are gone;

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1255	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1256	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1257	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1258	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1259	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	It would have madded me. What shall I do,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1260	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Now I behold thy lively body so?
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1261	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1262	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1268	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Upon a gathered lily almost withered.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1269	speech	verse	Marcus_Tit	Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1270	speech	verse	Marcus_Tit	Perchance because she knows them innocent.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1271	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1272	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Because the law hath ta’en revenge on them.—
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1273	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	No, no, they would not do so foul a deed.
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1274	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.—

Titus Andronicus	3	1	1284	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	And made a brine pit with our bitter tears?
Titus Andronicus	3	1	1285	speech	verse	Titus_Tit	Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?

Titus Andronicus	4	2	1741	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	To brave the tribune in his brother’s hearing.

Titus Andronicus	5	1	2210	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	What if I do not? As indeed I do not.

Titus Andronicus	5	1	2232	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Why, she was washed, and cut, and trimmed; and ’twas
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2233	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2234	speech	verse	Lucius_Tit	O, barbarous beastly villains, like thyself!
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2235	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.

Titus Andronicus	5	1	2242	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2243	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	I wrote the letter that thy father found,

Titus Andronicus	5	1	2245	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Confederate with the Queen and her two sons.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2246	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And what not done that thou hast cause to rue,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2247	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2248	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	I played the cheater for thy father’s hand,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2249	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And, when I had it, drew myself apart
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2250	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2251	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	I pried me through the crevice of a wall
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2252	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	When, for his hand, he had his two sons’ heads,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2253	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Beheld his tears, and laughed so heartily
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2254	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	That both mine eyes were rainy like to his.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2255	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And when I told the Empress of this sport,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2256	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2257	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2258	speech	verse	GOTHS.0_Tit	What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2259	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2260	speech	verse	Lucius_Tit	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?

Titus Andronicus	5	1	2262	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Even now I curse the day—and yet, I think,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2263	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Few come within the compass of my curse—
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2264	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2265	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	As kill a man, or else devise his death;

Titus Andronicus	5	1	2267	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Accuse some innocent and forswear myself;
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2268	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Set deadly enmity between two friends;
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2269	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Make poor men’s cattle break their necks;
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2270	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2271	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
Titus Andronicus	5	1	2272	speech	verse	Aaron_Tit	Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves
