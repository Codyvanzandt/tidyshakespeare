Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	201	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I must from this enchanting queen break off.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	202	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	203	speech	verse	Antony_JC	My idleness doth hatch.—How now, Enobarbus!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	204	direction	entrance	Enobarbus_Ant	Enter Enobarbus.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	205	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	What’s your pleasure, sir?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	206	speech	prose	Antony_JC	I must with haste from hence.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	207	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Why then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	208	speech	prose	Antony_JC	I must be gone.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	209	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause, they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	210	speech	prose	Antony_JC	She is cunning past man’s thought.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	211	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	212	speech	prose	Antony_JC	Would I had never seen her!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	213	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	214	speech	prose	Antony_JC	Fulvia is dead.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	215	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Sir?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	216	speech	prose	Antony_JC	Fulvia is dead.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	217	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Fulvia?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	218	speech	prose	Antony_JC	Dead.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	219	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the Earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	220	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The business she hath broachèd in the state
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	221	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Cannot endure my absence.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	222	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	223	speech	verse	Antony_JC	No more light answers. Let our officers
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	224	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	225	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The cause of our expedience to the Queen
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	226	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And get her leave to part. For not alone

Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	229	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	230	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	231	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands

Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	240	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life
Antony and Cleopatra	1	2	241	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure,

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	267	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	268	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	269	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Will not sustain it.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	270	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Now, my dearest queen—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	271	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Pray you stand farther from me.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	272	speech	verse	Antony_JC	What’s the matter?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	273	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	I know by that same eye there’s some good news.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	274	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	What, says the married woman you may go?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	275	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Would she had never given you leave to come.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	276	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here.

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	279	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O, never was there queen
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	280	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	281	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	I saw the treasons planted.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	282	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Cleopatra—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	283	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Why should I think you can be mine, and true—

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	285	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	287	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Which break themselves in swearing!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	288	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Most sweet queen—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	289	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Nay, pray you seek no color for your going,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	290	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	But bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	291	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Then was the time for words. No going then!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	292	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	293	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Bliss in our brows’ bent; none our parts so poor
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	294	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	295	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	296	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Art turned the greatest liar.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	297	speech	verse	Antony_JC	How now, lady?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	298	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	299	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	There were a heart in Egypt.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	300	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Hear me, queen:
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	301	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The strong necessity of time commands
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	302	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Our services awhile, but my full heart
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	303	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Remains in use with you. Our Italy
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	304	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Shines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	305	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	306	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Equality of two domestic powers
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	307	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Breed scrupulous faction; the hated grown to strength
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	308	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Are newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	309	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	310	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	311	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	312	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	313	speech	verse	Antony_JC	By any desperate change. My more particular,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	314	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And that which most with you should safe my going,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	315	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Is Fulvia’s death.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	316	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	317	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	320	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	322	speech	verse	Antony_JC	See when and where she died.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	323	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O, most false love!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	324	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	325	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	326	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	In Fulvia’s death, how mine received shall be.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	327	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	328	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The purposes I bear, which are or cease
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	329	speech	verse	Antony_JC	As you shall give th’ advice. By the fire

Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	333	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	334	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	But let it be; I am quickly ill and well;
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	335	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	So Antony loves.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	336	speech	verse	Antony_JC	My precious queen, forbear,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	337	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And give true evidence to his love, which stands
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	338	speech	verse	Antony_JC	An honorable trial.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	339	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	So Fulvia told me.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	340	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	I prithee turn aside and weep for her,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	341	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	342	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	343	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	344	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Like perfect honor.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	345	speech	verse	Antony_JC	You’ll heat my blood. No more!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	346	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	347	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Now by my sword—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	348	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	And target. Still he mends.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	349	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	350	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	How this Herculean Roman does become
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	351	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	The carriage of his chafe.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	352	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I’ll leave you, lady.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	353	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Courteous lord, one word.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	354	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it;
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	355	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Sir, you and I have loved, but there’s not it;
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	356	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	That you know well. Something it is I would—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	357	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	358	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	And I am all forgotten.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	359	speech	verse	Antony_JC	But that your Royalty
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	360	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	361	speech	verse	Antony_JC	For idleness itself.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	362	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	’Tis sweating labor
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	363	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	To bear such idleness so near the heart
Antony and Cleopatra	1	3	364	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,

Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	395	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	396	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	397	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	398	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet

Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	433	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.CAESAR.2_Ant	With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	434	speech	verse	MESSENGERS.CAESAR.2_Ant	They make in Italy—the borders maritime

Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	439	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Antony,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	440	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	441	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	442	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Hirsius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	443	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Did famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	444	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	445	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	446	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	447	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	448	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	449	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	450	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The barks of trees thou browsèd. On the Alps
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	451	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	452	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Which some did die to look on. And all this—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	453	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	It wounds thine honor that I speak it now—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	454	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek

Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	456	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	’Tis pity of him.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	4	457	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Let his shames quickly

Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	484	speech	verse	Mardian_Ant	What’s your Highness’ pleasure?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	485	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure

Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	487	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	488	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	490	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Indeed?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	491	speech	verse	Mardian_Ant	Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	492	speech	verse	Mardian_Ant	But what indeed is honest to be done.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	493	speech	verse	Mardian_Ant	Yet have I fierce affections, and think
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	494	speech	verse	Mardian_Ant	What Venus did with Mars.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	495	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O, Charmian,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	496	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Where think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	497	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	498	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	499	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	500	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	The demi-Atlas of this Earth, the arm
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	501	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	And burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	502	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	503	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	504	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	With most delicious poison. Think on me
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	505	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	506	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	507	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	When thou wast here above the ground, I was
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	508	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	509	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	510	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	There would he anchor his aspect, and die

Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	513	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	514	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	515	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Yet coming from him, that great med’cine hath
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	516	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	With his tinct gilded thee.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	517	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	518	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Last thing he did, dear queen,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	519	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	520	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	521	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Mine ear must pluck it thence.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	522	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	“Good friend,” quoth he,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	523	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	“Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	524	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	525	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	To mend the petty present, I will piece
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	526	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	527	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	528	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	529	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	530	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Was beastly dumbed by him.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	531	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	What, was he sad, or merry?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	532	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Like to the time o’ th’ year between th’ extremes
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	533	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	534	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O, well-divided disposition!—Note him,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	535	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man! But note him:
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	536	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	He was not sad, for he would shine on those
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	537	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	538	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	539	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	540	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	O, heavenly mingle!—Be’st thou sad or merry,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	541	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	The violence of either thee becomes,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	542	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	So does it no man’s else.—Met’st thou my posts?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	543	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	544	speech	verse	Alexas_Ant	Why do you send so thick?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	545	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Who’s born that day
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	546	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	When I forget to send to Antony
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	547	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Shall die a beggar.—Ink and paper, Charmian.—
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	548	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Welcome, my good Alexas.—Did I, Charmian,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	549	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Ever love Caesar so?
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	550	speech	verse	Charmian_Ant	O, that brave Caesar!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	551	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Be choked with such another emphasis!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	552	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Say “the brave Antony.”
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	553	speech	verse	Charmian_Ant	The valiant Caesar!
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	554	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	555	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	If thou with Caesar paragon again
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	556	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	My man of men.
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	557	speech	verse	Charmian_Ant	By your most gracious pardon,
Antony and Cleopatra	1	5	558	speech	verse	Charmian_Ant	I sing but after you.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	571	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays

Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	575	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	Deny us for our good; so find we profit
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	576	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	By losing of our prayers.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	581	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	582	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	583	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	584	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Of both is flattered; but he neither loves,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	585	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Nor either cares for him.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	586	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	Caesar and Lepidus
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	587	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	589	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	From Silvius, sir.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	590	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	591	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	592	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	593	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	594	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	595	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	596	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	597	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor

Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	601	speech	verse	Varrius_Ant	This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	602	speech	verse	Varrius_Ant	Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	603	speech	verse	Varrius_Ant	Expected. Since he went from Egypt ’tis
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	604	speech	verse	Varrius_Ant	A space for farther travel.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	605	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	I could have given less matter
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	606	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	A better ear.—Menas, I did not think
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	607	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	608	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	For such a petty war. His soldiership
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	609	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	610	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	The higher our opinion, that our stirring
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	611	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	612	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	613	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	I cannot hope
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	614	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	615	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	616	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	His brother warred upon him, although I think
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	617	speech	verse	Menas_Ant	Not moved by Antony.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	618	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	I know not, Menas,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	619	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	620	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	Were ’t not that we stand up against them all,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	621	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	622	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	For they have entertainèd cause enough
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	623	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	624	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	May cement their divisions and bind up
Antony and Cleopatra	2	1	625	speech	verse	Pompey_Ant	The petty difference, we yet not know.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	636	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Let Antony look over Caesar’s head

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	658	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	A leaner action rend us. What’s amiss,

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	665	speech	verse	Antony_JC	’Tis spoken well.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	666	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Were we before our armies, and to fight,

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	672	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Sit, sir.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	677	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	I must be laughed at
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	678	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	If or for nothing or a little, I
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	679	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Should say myself offended, and with you
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	680	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at, that I should
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	681	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Once name you derogately when to sound your name
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	682	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	It not concerned me.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	683	speech	verse	Antony_JC	My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	684	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	No more than my residing here at Rome
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	685	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Might be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	686	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	687	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Might be my question.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	688	speech	verse	Antony_JC	How intend you, practiced?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	689	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	690	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	691	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Made wars upon me, and their contestation
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	692	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	693	speech	verse	Antony_JC	You do mistake your business. My brother never
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	694	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	695	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And have my learning from some true reports
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	696	speech	verse	Antony_JC	That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	697	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Discredit my authority with yours,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	698	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And make the wars alike against my stomach,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	699	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	700	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Before did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	701	speech	verse	Antony_JC	As matter whole you have to make it with,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	702	speech	verse	Antony_JC	It must not be with this.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	703	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	You praise yourself
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	704	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	By laying defects of judgment to me; but
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	705	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	You patched up your excuses.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	706	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Not so, not so.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	707	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I know you could not lack—I am certain on ’t—
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	708	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Very necessity of this thought, that I,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	709	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	710	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	711	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	712	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I would you had her spirit in such another.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	713	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	714	speech	verse	Antony_JC	You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	715	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	716	speech	verse	Antony_JC	So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	717	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Made out of her impatience—which not wanted
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	718	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Shrewdness of policy too—I grieving grant
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	719	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	720	speech	verse	Antony_JC	But say I could not help it.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	721	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	I wrote to you
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	722	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	When rioting in Alexandria; you
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	723	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	724	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Did gibe my missive out of audience.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	725	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Sir,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	726	speech	verse	Antony_JC	He fell upon me ere admitted, then;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	727	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	728	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Of what I was i’ th’ morning. But next day
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	729	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I told him of myself, which was as much
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	730	speech	verse	Antony_JC	As to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	731	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	732	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Out of our question wipe him.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	733	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	You have broken
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	734	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The article of your oath, which you shall never
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	735	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Have tongue to charge me with.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	736	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	Soft, Caesar!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	737	speech	verse	Antony_JC	No, Lepidus, let him speak.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	738	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The honor is sacred which he talks on now,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	739	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Supposing that I lacked it.—But on, Caesar:
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	740	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The article of my oath?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	741	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	To lend me arms and aid when I required them,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	742	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The which you both denied.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	743	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Neglected, rather;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	744	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	745	speech	verse	Antony_JC	From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	746	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I’ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	747	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	748	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	749	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	750	speech	verse	Antony_JC	For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	751	speech	verse	Antony_JC	So far ask pardon as befits mine honor
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	752	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To stoop in such a case.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	753	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	’Tis noble spoken.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	754	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	If it might please you to enforce no further
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	755	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	The griefs between you, to forget them quite
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	756	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	Were to remember that the present need
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	757	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	Speaks to atone you.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	758	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	759	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	760	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	761	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	762	speech	verse	Antony_JC	You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	763	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Go to, then. Your considerate stone.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	764	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	I do not much dislike the matter, but
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	765	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The manner of his speech; for ’t cannot be
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	766	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	767	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	So diff’ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	768	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	What hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	769	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	O’ th’ world I would pursue it.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	770	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Give me leave, Caesar.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	771	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Speak, Agrippa.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	772	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	773	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	774	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Is now a widower.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	775	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Say not so, Agrippa.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	776	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	777	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Were well deserved of rashness.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	778	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	779	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Agrippa further speak.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	780	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	To hold you in perpetual amity,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	781	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	782	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	With an unslipping knot, take Antony
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	783	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	784	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	No worse a husband than the best of men;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	785	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	786	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	That which none else can utter. By this marriage
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	787	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	All little jealousies, which now seem great,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	788	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	789	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	790	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to both
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	791	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Would each to other and all loves to both
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	792	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	793	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	For ’tis a studied, not a present thought,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	794	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	By duty ruminated.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	795	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Will Caesar speak?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	796	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Not till he hears how Antony is touched
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	797	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	With what is spoke already.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	798	speech	verse	Antony_JC	What power is in Agrippa,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	799	speech	verse	Antony_JC	If I would say “Agrippa, be it so,”
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	800	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To make this good?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	801	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The power of Caesar, and
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	802	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	His power unto Octavia.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	803	speech	verse	Antony_JC	May I never
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	804	speech	verse	Antony_JC	To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	805	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Dream of impediment. Let me have thy hand.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	807	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The heart of brothers govern in our loves
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	808	speech	verse	Antony_JC	And sway our great designs.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	811	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	A sister I bequeath you whom no brother
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	812	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	813	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	814	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Fly off our loves again.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	815	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	Happily, amen!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	816	speech	verse	Antony_JC	I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	817	speech	verse	Antony_JC	For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	818	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	819	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	820	speech	verse	Antony_JC	At heel of that, defy him.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	822	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	823	speech	verse	Lepidus_JC	Or else he seeks out us.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	824	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Where lies he?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	825	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	About the Mount Misena.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	826	speech	verse	Antony_JC	What is his strength by land?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	827	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Great and increasing;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	828	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	But by sea he is an absolute master.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	829	speech	verse	Antony_JC	So is the fame.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	830	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Would we had spoke together. Haste we for it.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	831	speech	verse	Antony_JC	Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	832	speech	verse	Antony_JC	The business we have talked of.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	833	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	With most gladness,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	834	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	And do invite you to my sister’s view,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	835	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Whither straight I’ll lead you.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	844	speech	prose	Maecenas_Ant	We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	845	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	847	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	851	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	I will tell you.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	852	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	The barge she sat in like a burnished throne
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	853	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	854	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	855	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	The winds were lovesick with them. The oars were silver,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	856	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	857	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	The water which they beat to follow faster,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	858	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	859	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	It beggared all description: she did lie
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	860	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold, of tissue—
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	861	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	O’erpicturing that Venus where we see
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	862	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	The fancy outwork nature. On each side her
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	863	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	864	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	865	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	866	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	And what they undid did.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	867	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	O, rare for Antony!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	868	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	869	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	So many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	870	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	And made their bends adornings. At the helm
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	871	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	872	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	873	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	That yarely frame the office. From the barge
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	874	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	875	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	876	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Her people out upon her; and Antony,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	877	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Enthroned i’ th’ market-place, did sit alone,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	878	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Whistling to th’ air, which but for vacancy
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	879	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	880	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	And made a gap in nature.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	881	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Rare Egyptian!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	882	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	883	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Invited her to supper. She replied
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	884	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	It should be better he became her guest,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	885	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	886	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Whom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	887	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Being barbered ten times o’er, goes to the feast,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	888	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	And for his ordinary pays his heart

Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	890	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Royal wench!
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	891	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	892	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	He ploughed her, and she cropped.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	893	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	I saw her once
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	894	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Hop forty paces through the public street,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	895	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	And having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	896	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	That she did make defect perfection,
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	897	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	And breathless pour breath forth.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	898	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	Now Antony must leave her utterly.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	899	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Never. He will not.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	2	900	speech	verse	Enobarbus_Ant	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale

Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1270	speech	prose	Menas_Ant	You’ve said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1271	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1272	speech	prose	Menas_Ant	True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1278	speech	prose	Menas_Ant	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1279	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	I think so, too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1280	speech	prose	Menas_Ant	Who would not have his wife so?
Antony and Cleopatra	2	6	1281	speech	prose	Enobarbus_Ant	Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is. He married but his occasion here.

Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1744	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	His part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1745	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1746	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1747	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Should be deposed and, being, that we detain

Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1749	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Sir, this should be answered.
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1750	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	’Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1751	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1752	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	That he his high authority abused
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1753	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	And did deserve his change. For what I have conquered,
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1754	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	I grant him part; but then in his Armenia
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1755	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	And other of his conquered kingdoms I
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1756	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Demand the like.
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1757	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	He’ll never yield to that.

Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1762	speech	verse	Octavia_Ant	You have not called me so, nor have you cause.
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1763	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Why have you stol’n upon us thus? You come not
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1764	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Like Caesar’s sister. The wife of Antony
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1765	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Should have an army for an usher and
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1766	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1767	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Long ere she did appear. The trees by th’ way
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1768	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,

Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1790	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	No, my most wrongèd sister. Cleopatra
Antony and Cleopatra	3	6	1791	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire

Antony and Cleopatra	4	15	3071	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	All strange and terrible events are welcome,

Antony and Cleopatra	4	15	3138	speech	verse	Antony_JC	My countryman—a Roman by a Roman

Antony and Cleopatra	4	15	3163	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	And does the meanest chares. It were for me

Antony and Cleopatra	4	15	3175	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion
Antony and Cleopatra	4	15	3176	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	And make death proud to take us. Come, away.

Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3200	speech	verse	GUARDS.Dercetus_Ant	I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3201	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The breaking of so great a thing should make
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3202	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	A greater crack. The round world
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3203	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Should have shook lions into civil streets
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3204	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3205	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Is not a single doom; in the name lay

Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3207	speech	verse	GUARDS.Dercetus_Ant	He is dead, Caesar,

Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3215	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Look you sad, friends?
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3216	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3217	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	To wash the eyes of kings.
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3218	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	And strange it is
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3219	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	That nature must compel us to lament

Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3224	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Did steer humanity, but you gods will give us
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3225	speech	verse	Agrippa_Ant	Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touched.
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3226	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	When such a spacious mirror’s set before him,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3227	speech	verse	Maecenas_Ant	He needs must see himself.
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3228	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	O Antony,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3229	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	I have followed thee to this, but we do lance
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3230	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3231	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Have shown to thee such a declining day
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3232	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Or look on thine. We could not stall together
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3233	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	In the whole world. But yet let me lament
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3234	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3235	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	That thou my brother, my competitor

Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3240	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Unreconciliable should divide

Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3245	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	We’ll hear him what he says.—Whence are you?
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3246	speech	verse	Egyptian_Ant	A poor Egyptian yet, the Queen my mistress,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3247	speech	verse	Egyptian_Ant	Confined in all she has, her monument,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3248	speech	verse	Egyptian_Ant	Of thy intents desires instruction,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3249	speech	verse	Egyptian_Ant	That she preparedly may frame herself
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3250	speech	verse	Egyptian_Ant	To th’ way she’s forced to.
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3251	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Bid her have good heart.
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3252	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3253	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	How honorable and how kindly we
Antony and Cleopatra	5	1	3254	speech	verse	Octavius_JC	Determine for her. For Caesar cannot live

Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3391	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3392	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,

Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3394	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	That grew the more by reaping. His delights
Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3395	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Were dolphin-like; they showed his back above
Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3396	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	The element they lived in. In his livery
Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3397	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	Walked crowns and crownets; realms and islands were

Antony and Cleopatra	5	2	3405	speech	verse	Cleopatra_Ant	It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff
