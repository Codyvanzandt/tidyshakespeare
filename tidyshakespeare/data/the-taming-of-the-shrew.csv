Your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you.—Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out. Our cake’s dough on both sides. Farewell. Yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	121	speech	prose	Hortensio_Shr	So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both (that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love) to labor and effect one thing specially.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	122	speech	prose	Gremio_Shr	What’s that, I pray?

The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	126	speech	prose	Gremio_Shr	I say “a devil.” Think’st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	127	speech	prose	Hortensio_Shr	Tush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	128	speech	prose	Gremio_Shr	I cannot tell. But I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross every morning.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	129	speech	prose	Hortensio_Shr	Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to ’t afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	130	speech	prose	Gremio_Shr	I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her. Come on.

The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	133	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	That love should of a sudden take such hold?
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	134	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	135	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	I never thought it possible or likely.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	136	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	But see, while idly I stood looking on,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	137	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	I found the effect of love-in-idleness,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	138	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	And now in plainness do confess to thee
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	139	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	That art to me as secret and as dear
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	140	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was:

The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	151	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Master, you looked so longly on the maid,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	152	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	153	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	154	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	155	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	156	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	157	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	158	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	159	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	160	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	161	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	And with her breath she did perfume the air.

The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	166	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	167	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	168	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	That till the father rid his hands of her,

The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	170	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	And therefore has he closely mewed her up,
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	171	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	172	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	173	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	But art thou not advised he took some care

The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	175	speech	verse	Tranio_Shr	Ay, marry, am I, sir—and now ’tis plotted!
The Taming of the Shrew	1	1	176	speech	verse	Lucentio_Shr	I have it, Tranio!

The Taming of the Shrew	4	1	1404	speech	prose	Curtis_Shr	By this reck’ning, he is more shrew than she.
The Taming of the Shrew	4	1	1405	speech	prose	Grumio_Shr	Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Phillip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
