Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	779	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	To dash our late decree in Parliament
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	780	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	781	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	782	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Our battles joined, and both sides fiercely fought.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	783	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	But whether ’twas the coldness of the King,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	784	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Who looked full gently on his warlike queen,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	785	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	786	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Or whether ’twas report of her success
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	787	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigor,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	788	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	789	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	I cannot judge; but to conclude with truth,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	790	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	791	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Our soldiers’, like the night owl’s lazy flight
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	792	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	793	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	794	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	I cheered them up with justice of our cause,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	795	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	With promise of high pay and great rewards,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	796	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	797	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And we, in them, no hope to win the day,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	798	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	799	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	800	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	In haste, posthaste, are come to join with you;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	801	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	For in the Marches here we heard you were,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	802	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Making another head to fight again.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	803	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	804	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And when came George from Burgundy to England?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	805	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	806	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And, for your brother, he was lately sent
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	807	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	808	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	809	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	810	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	811	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	812	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	813	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	814	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	815	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And wring the awful scepter from his fist,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	816	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Were he as famous and as bold in war
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	817	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	818	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	819	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	820	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But in this troublous time, what’s to be done?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	821	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	822	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	823	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Numb’ring our Ave Marys with our beads?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	824	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	825	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	826	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	If for the last, say “Ay,” and to it, lords.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	827	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	828	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	829	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Attend me, lords: the proud insulting queen,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	830	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	With Clifford and the haught Northumberland
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	831	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And of their feather many more proud birds,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	832	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	833	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	He swore consent to your succession,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	834	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	His oath enrollèd in the Parliament.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	835	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And now to London all the crew are gone
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	836	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	To frustrate both his oath and what beside
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	837	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	May make against the house of Lancaster.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	838	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	839	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	840	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	841	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	842	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	843	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Why, via, to London will we march,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	844	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	845	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And once again cry “Charge!” upon our foes,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	846	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	But never once again turn back and fly.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	847	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	848	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	849	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That cries “Retire!” if Warwick bid him stay.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	850	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	851	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And when thou fail’st—as God forbid the hour!—
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	852	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	853	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;

Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	856	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	In every borough as we pass along,

Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	858	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	859	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	1	860	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,

Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	972	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	973	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	You that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	974	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Have caused him, by new act of Parliament,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	975	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	To blot out me and put his own son in.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	976	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	And reason too:
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	977	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	Who should succeed the father but the son?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	978	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	979	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	Ay, crookback, here I stand to answer thee,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	980	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	Or any he, the proudest of thy sort.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	981	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Twas you that killed young Rutland, was it not?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	982	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	983	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	For God’s sake, lords, give signal to the fight!
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	984	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	What sayst thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	985	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick, dare you speak?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	986	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	When you and I met at Saint Albans last,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	987	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Your legs did better service than your hands.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	988	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Then ’twas my turn to fly, and now ’tis thine.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	989	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	You said so much before, and yet you fled.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	990	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	’Twas not your valor, Clifford, drove me thence.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	991	speech	verse	Northumberland_3H6	No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	992	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.—
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	993	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	994	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	The execution of my big-swoll’n heart
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	995	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	996	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	I slew thy father; call’st thou him a child?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	997	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	998	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	999	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	But ere sunset I’ll make thee curse the deed.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1000	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1001	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Defy them, then, or else hold close thy lips.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1002	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	I prithee, give no limits to my tongue.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1003	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	I am a king and privileged to speak.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1004	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1005	speech	verse	Clifford_3H6	Cannot be cured by words; therefore, be still.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1006	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1007	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	By Him that made us all, I am resolved
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1008	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That Clifford’s manhood lies upon his tongue.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1009	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Say, Henry, shall I have my right or no?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1010	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	A thousand men have broke their fasts today
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1011	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	That ne’er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1012	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1013	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	For York in justice puts his armor on.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1014	speech	verse	PrinceEdward_3H6	If that be right which Warwick says is right,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1015	speech	verse	PrinceEdward_3H6	There is no wrong, but everything is right.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1016	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1017	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	For well I wot thou hast thy mother’s tongue.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1018	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1019	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1020	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Marked by the Destinies to be avoided,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1021	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	As venom toads or lizards’ dreadful stings.

Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1023	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Whose father bears the title of a king,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1024	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	As if a channel should be called the sea,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1025	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Sham’st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1026	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1027	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1028	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	To make this shameless callet know herself.—
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1029	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1030	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1031	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And ne’er was Agamemnon’s brother wronged
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1032	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	By that false woman as this king by thee.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1033	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	His father reveled in the heart of France,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1034	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And tamed the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1035	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And had he matched according to his state,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1036	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	He might have kept that glory to this day.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1037	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	But when he took a beggar to his bed
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1038	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1039	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1040	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	That washed his father’s fortunes forth of France
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1041	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And heaped sedition on his crown at home.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1042	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride?
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1043	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1044	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1045	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Had slipped our claim until another age.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1046	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1047	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And that thy summer bred us no increase,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1048	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	We set the axe to thy usurping root;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1049	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1050	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1051	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	We’ll never leave till we have hewn thee down
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1052	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1053	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And in this resolution, I defy thee,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1054	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Not willing any longer conference,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	2	1055	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Since thou denied’st the gentle king to speak.—

Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1363	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Now death shall stop his dismal threat’ning sound,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1364	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1365	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	I think his understanding is bereft.—
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1366	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?—
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1367	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Dark cloudy death o’ershades his beams of life,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1368	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1369	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	O, would he did—and so, perhaps, he doth!
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1370	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	’Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1371	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1372	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Which in the time of death he gave our father.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1373	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	If so thou think’st, vex him with eager words.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1374	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1375	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1377	speech	verse	Clarence_3H6	While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1378	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1379	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Thou pitied’st Rutland; I will pity thee.

Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1382	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	What, not an oath? Nay, then, the world goes hard
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1383	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1384	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	I know by that he’s dead; and, by my soul,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1385	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	If this right hand would buy but two hours’ life
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1386	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	That I in all despite might rail at him,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1387	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1388	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	Stifle the villain whose unstaunchèd thirst
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1389	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1390	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Ay, but he’s dead. Off with the traitor’s head,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1391	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And rear it in the place your father’s stands.

Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1401	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	First will I see the coronation,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1402	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And then to Brittany I’ll cross the sea
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1403	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1404	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1405	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1406	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	And never will I undertake the thing
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1407	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.—
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1408	speech	verse	EdwardIV_3H6	Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,

Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1412	speech	verse	RichardIII_R3	For Gloucester’s dukedom is too ominous.
Henry VI, Part 3	2	6	1413	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Tut, that’s a foolish observation.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1452	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	To wife for Edward. If this news be true,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1453	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1454	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	For Warwick is a subtle orator,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1455	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1456	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	By this account, then, Margaret may win him,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1457	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	For she’s a woman to be pitied much.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1459	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Her tears will pierce into a marble heart.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1476	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	Say, what art thou that talk’st of kings and queens?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1477	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1478	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	A man at least, for less I should not be;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1479	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1480	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	Ay, but thou talk’st as if thou wert a king.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1481	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Why, so I am in mind, and that’s enough.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1482	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	But if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1483	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1484	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1485	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Nor to be seen. My crown is called content;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1486	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1487	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	Well, if you be a king crowned with content,

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1489	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	To go along with us. For, as we think,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1490	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1491	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1493	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	But did you never swear and break an oath?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1494	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.2_3H6	No, never such an oath, nor will not now.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1495	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Where did you dwell when I was King of England?

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1501	speech	verse	GAMEKEEPERS.1_3H6	No, for we were subjects but while you were king.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1502	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1503	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1504	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Look as I blow this feather from my face

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1507	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	And yielding to another when it blows,

Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1509	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	Such is the lightness of you common men.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	1	1510	speech	verse	HenryVI_1H6	But do not break your oaths, for of that sin

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1748	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1749	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1750	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1751	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1752	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1753	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1754	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Great Albion’s queen in former golden days,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1755	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But now mischance hath trod my title down
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1756	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And with dishonor laid me on the ground,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1757	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1758	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And to my humble seat conform myself.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1759	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1760	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1761	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And stops my tongue, while heart is drowned in cares.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1762	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Whate’er it be, be thou still like thyself,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1763	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	And sit thee by our side.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1764	direction	business	QueenMargaret_1H6	Seats her by him.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1767	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1768	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1769	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	It shall be eased if France can yield relief.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1770	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1771	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1772	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1773	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1774	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Is, of a king, become a banished man
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1775	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1776	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1777	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Usurps the regal title and the seat
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1778	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Of England’s true-anointed lawful king.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1779	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1780	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1781	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1782	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1783	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Scotland hath will to help but cannot help;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1784	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Our people and our peers are both misled,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1785	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Our treasure seized, our soldiers put to flight,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1786	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1787	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Renownèd queen, with patience calm the storm
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1788	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	While we bethink a means to break it off.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1789	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1790	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	The more I stay, the more I’ll succor thee.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1793	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1794	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1795	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1801	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1802	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1803	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	My lord and sovereign and thy vowèd friend,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1804	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	I come in kindness and unfeignèd love,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1805	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	First, to do greetings to thy royal person,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1806	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And then to crave a league of amity,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1807	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And, lastly, to confirm that amity
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1808	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1809	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1810	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	To England’s king in lawful marriage.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1813	direction	delivery	Warwick_2H6	, speaking to Lady Bona
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1814	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And, gracious madam, in our king’s behalf,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1815	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	I am commanded, with your leave and favor,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1816	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1817	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1818	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Where fame, late ent’ring at his heedful ears,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1819	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1820	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1821	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1822	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1823	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	But from deceit, bred by necessity;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1824	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	For how can tyrants safely govern home
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1825	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1826	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	To prove him tyrant, this reason may suffice:
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1827	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1828	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1829	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1830	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1831	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1832	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1833	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Injurious Margaret!
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1834	speech	verse	PrinceEdward_3H6	And why not “Queen”?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1835	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Because thy father Henry did usurp,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1836	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And thou no more art prince than she is queen.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1837	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1838	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1839	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1840	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1841	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1842	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Who by his prowess conquerèd all France.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1843	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	From these our Henry lineally descends.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1844	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1845	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1846	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1847	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1848	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	But, for the rest: you tell a pedigree
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1849	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Of threescore and two years, a silly time
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1850	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1851	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1852	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Whom thou obeyed’st thirty and six years,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1853	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1854	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1855	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1856	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1857	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Call him my king, by whose injurious doom
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1858	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1859	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Was done to death? And more than so, my father,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1860	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	Even in the downfall of his mellowed years,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1861	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	When nature brought him to the door of death?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1862	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	No, Warwick, no. While life upholds this arm,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1863	speech	verse	Oxford_3H6	This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1864	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	And I the house of York.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1865	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1866	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1867	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	While I use further conference with Warwick.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1868	direction	business	QueenMargaret_1H6	They stand aloof.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1868	direction	business	PrinceEdward_3H6	They stand aloof.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1868	direction	business	Oxford_3H6	They stand aloof.

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1870	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him not.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1871	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1872	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Is Edward your true king? For I were loath
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1873	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1874	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1875	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	But is he gracious in the people’s eye?
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1876	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	The more that Henry was unfortunate.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1877	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1878	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1879	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Unto our sister Bona.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1880	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Such it seems
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1881	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1882	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Myself have often heard him say and swear
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1883	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	That this his love was an eternal plant,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1884	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Whereof the root was fixed in virtue’s ground,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1885	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	The leaves and fruit maintained with beauty’s sun,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1886	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Exempt from envy but not from disdain,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1887	speech	verse	Warwick_2H6	Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1888	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1889	speech	verse	LadyBona_3H6	Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1890	speech	verse	LadyBona_3H6	Yet I confess that often ere this day,

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1894	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1895	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1896	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1897	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.—
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1898	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1899	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1900	speech	verse	PrinceEdward_3H6	To Edward, but not to the English king.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1901	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1903	speech	verse	QueenMargaret_1H6	Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry’s friend.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1904	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	And still is friend to him and Margaret.
Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1905	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	But if your title to the crown be weak,

Henry VI, Part 3	3	3	1907	speech	verse	KingLewis_3H6	Then ’tis but reason that I be released
